        "Bureau / Department": "CBP",
        "Use Case Name": "Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) 3D Imaging Tool",
        "Benefit Statement": "Utilizes AI/ML to generate high resolution, rapid imaging of objects behind occlusions; create 3D images for existing processes without significant slowdowns; and provide a novel narcotics detection capability for the inspection of packages.",
        "System Outputs": "Detection alerts for Items of Interest.",
        "Response": "### **A. Named Entity Relationships**\n- **PERSON**: Not applicable.\n- **ORGANIZATION**: Department of Homeland Security (DHS), CBP.\n- **LOCATION**: Not mentioned.\n- **DATE**: Not applicable.\n\n### **B. Dependency Parsing and Analysis**\nThe grammatical relationships identified are subject-verb-object, with the AI/ML system as the subject, generating high resolution imaging or providing a novel narcotics detection capability as the verb, and CBP processes as the object. The key sentence structure reflecting goals is \"to provide.\" There are no incomplete dependencies identified in this use case.\n\n### **C. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**\nThe functional requirements include data processing and imaging, while the non-functional requirement is performance. Rationale for the non-functional requirement is that CBP needs to rapidly inspect packages without significant slowdowns, indicating the system should be able to handle large volumes of data quickly. The dependencies identified are between the AI/ML system generating images and the existing processes within CBP.\n\n### **D. Value Categorization**\nThe use case can be classified as a Capability Enhancer due to its introduction of new capabilities, specifically 3D imaging for narcotics detection.\n\n### **E. Operational Impact and Transformation**\nThe operational impact is the improvement in efficiency due to the rapid inspection of packages without significant slowdowns, while the transformation is overcoming limitations posed by traditional methods of narcotics detection.\n\n### **F. Value Metrics**\nValue metrics can be measured through increased operational efficiency and reduced cost for CBP resulting from the use of the AI/ML system. Additionally, societal impacts like improved security could also be considered a value metric."

        "Benefit Statement": "CBP uses this tool to conduct targeted queries to aid CBP in open source research to monitor potential threats or dangers or identify travelers who may be subject to further inspection for violation of laws CBP is authorized to enforce or administer.\n",
        "System Outputs": "Babel utilizes AI modules for Text detection and translation as well as object and image recognition to provide analysts with possible matches to manually review in a single interface versus doing multiple manual queries. The output is not singly used for action or decision making and are used to identify additional Open Source or Social Media of a person or identify additional selectors (such as phone and emails) that are previously unknown to CBP and compared by an analyst against Government systems to identify additional derogatory information. These factors can often eliminate the traveler from additional screening.\n",
