The autonomous system introduces a new operational paradigm for OFO, enabling fully autonomous underwater missions that provide obstacle detection and collision avoidance. This represents a significant departure from traditional workflows, which rely on dive teams or larger ROV units borrowed from Local, State, or Federal partners.\nBy providing real-time shared situational awareness for OFO and its strategic partners, the system can also introduce new operational paradigms that enhance collaboration among agencies. This transformation has significant implications for improving border security and preventing smuggling attempts on marine vessels entering and exiting ports of entry.\n4. **Risks and Mitigation Strategies**:\nOne potential risk associated with the use case is the possibility of false positives or false negatives in detecting parasitic loads on vessels. To mitigate this risk, OFO can implement quality control measures to ensure that the system's outputs are accurate and reliable. Additionally, OFO can train its personnel to interpret the system's outputs correctly and make informed decisions based on them.\nAnother potential risk is the possibility of ethical concerns or biases in the data used to train the system.

        "Response": "1. **Categorization of Value Creation**:\nThe use case DHS-65 is categorized as an Efficiency Amplifier because it amplifies the efficiency of the existing surveillance system by enabling AI/ML algorithms to predict the final location of a suspect aircraft. The output results in a display of the top three final locations as displayed on AMOSS using green, yellow, and red lines to depict most to least probable outcomes. This automated process significantly reduces the time and effort required for an officer to manually evaluate flight paths and predict potential landing spots.\n2. **Operational Impact**:\nThe potential operational impact of DHS-65 includes improvements in process efficiencies, capability expansions, and the introduction of new operational paradigms. By automating the process of identifying suspect aircraft and predicting their final landing spots, CBP can significantly reduce the time required to respond to potential security threats. This not only improves the efficiency of the existing surveillance system but also expands its capability by enabling more accurate predictions of suspect aircraft movements. Additionally, DHS-65 introduces a new operational paradigm by leveraging AI/ML algorithms to predict aircraft movements based on historical flight paths.\n3. **Transformation Potential**:\nDHS-65 aligns with traditional workflows of CBP's Air & Marine Operations Surveillance System (AMOSS) by using existing radar tracks to predict potential landing spots. However, the use of AI/ML algorithms to automate this process represents a significant transformation in terms of the accuracy and speed of predictions. By leveraging AI/ML algorithms, CBP can significantly reduce the time required to respond to potential security threats, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of the surveillance system.\n4. **Risks and Mitigation Strategies**:\nPotential risks associated with DHS-65 include biases in the training data used to develop AI/ML algorithms, ethical concerns related to the use of AI/ML algorithms for predicting aircraft movements, and operational dependencies on AMOSS and other surveillance systems. To mitigate these risks, CBP can implement a comprehensive training program for its officers to ensure they understand how to use DHS-65 effectively and ethically. Additionally, CBP can conduct regular audits of the data used to train AI/ML algorithms to identify any potential biases or errors. Finally, CBP can establish contingency plans to ensure that surveillance operations can continue in the event of a system failure or other disruption.\n5. **Indicators of Value Creation**:\nKey indicators of value creation for DHS-65 include improved process efficiencies, reduced response times for potential security threats, and increased accuracy in predicting suspect aircraft movements. These metrics can be used to measure the effectiveness of DHS-65 and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, CBP can track changes in operational paradigms as a result of implementing DHS-65, such as an increase in the use of AI/ML algorithms for predicting aircraft movements.\n6. **Comparison to Similar Use Cases**:\nDHS-65 is similar to other AI use cases that leverage AI/ML algorithms to automate existing processes and improve operational efficiencies. For example, the Predictive Security Analytics (PSA) system used by DHS's Transportation Security Administration (TSA) leverages machine learning algorithms to identify potential security threats at aviation checkpoints. However, unlike PSA, DHS-65 does not require direct contact with passengers or their belongings and instead relies on surveillance data to predict aircraft movements.\n7. **Recommendations for Improvement**:\nTo improve the clarity, alignment, and strategic articulation of DHS-65, CBP can take several actionable recommendations. First, CBP should clearly define the objectives and outputs of DHS-65 to ensure that all stakeholders understand its purpose and value creation. Additionally, CBP should align DHS-65 with broader strategic priorities, such as improving border security or enhancing aviation safety. Finally, CBP should regularly evaluate the effectiveness of DHS-65 and identify opportunities for improvement based on feedback from officers and other stakeholders."

By reducing overall review time for NII images while facilitating legitimate trade and travel, it will increase clearance rate at border crossings, ultimately improving the efficiency and effectiveness of border security operations. Additionally, this use case has the potential to introduce new operational paradigms by leveraging AI algorithms to augment existing processes rather than replacing them altogether.\n3. **Transformation Potential**: This use case aligns with traditional workflows but departs from operational limitations and technological boundaries. By introducing AI-based solutions, CBP can transform their border security operations by leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of data in real-time. This transformation has the potential to revolutionize how border security operations are conducted by reducing manual efforts, increasing automation, and enhancing the accuracy of anomaly detection.\n4. **Risks and Mitigation Strategies**: There are several potential risks associated with this use case, such as ethical concerns relating to privacy and civil liberties, biases in algorithm design or data sampling, and operational dependencies on AI algorithms. To mitigate these risks, CBP must ensure that the implementation of AI-based solutions aligns with DHS's mission and values, including protecting civil rights and civil liberties. Additionally, CBP must ensure that the algorithm design is based on a representative sample of data to minimize biases in detection and classification. Finally, CBP must also have contingencies in place for scenarios where AI-based solutions may fail or require manual intervention.\n5. **Indicators of Value Creation**: The key indicators of value creation for this use case include operational metrics such as clearance rate at border crossings, reduction in overall review time for NII images, and increased accuracy of anomaly detection. Additionally, organizational benefits such as enhanced capability to detect contraband and anomalies, reduced risk of smuggling and trafficking activities, and improved efficiency of border security operations can be considered as explicit value drivers.\n6. **Comparison to Similar Use Cases**: This use case is similar to other AI-based solutions for non-intrusive inspection and anomaly detection in passenger vehicles and cargo conveyances. However, it differs based on its specific purpose statement, which aligns with DHS's goal to enhance the capability of humans by leveraging AI algorithms. The strategic articulation of this use case also highlights the potential transformation of border security operations rather than simply improving efficiency or reducing risk.\n7. **Recommendations for Improvement**: Based on the analysis, CBP should focus on developing clear implementation strategies that align with DHS's mission and values while addressing risks such as biases in algorithm design and data sampling. Additionally, CBP may consider investing in AI-based solutions that can adapt to changing operational contexts, such as varying levels of traffic at border crossings or evolving threats related to contraband smuggling and trafficking activities.\nOverall, this use case has the potential to transform border security operations by leveraging AI algorithms to facilitate non-intrusive inspection image analysis and augment existing processes while reducing overall review time for NII images. By identifying regions of interest within POVs and detecting anomalies through bounding boxes, CBP can enhance its capability to identify items of concern and improve clearance rates at border crossings, ultimately reducing the risk of smuggling and trafficking activities while facilitating legitimate trade and travel."

        "Response": "1. **Categorization of Value Creation:**\nThe DHS-2415 use case can be categorized as a Capability Enhancer because it improves the capabilities of CBP by enabling them to match passenger identities against trusted sources throughout the travel continuum. The purpose statement mentions that CBP uses facial recognition technology for process efficiency under the Visa Waiver system, using Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) Mobile, and in identifying arriving travelers at airports of entry, using Mobile Passport Control. The ESTA Mobile application captures a live photo from the traveler to perform a liveness test, and permit CBP\u2019s TVS to conduct a 1-to-1 comparison of the traveler\u2019s captured photo against the traveler\u2019s passport e-Chip photo. Similarly, Mobile Passport Control captures lives photos of a traveler to permit CBP\u2019s TVS to compare the photo to verified identifies compiled in flight galleries. This allows traveler to verify their identity using their mobile device, improving process efficiency and reducing manual identity verification. Therefore, the use case enables CBP to perform biometric matching using facial recognition technology, which was not possible earlier, enhancing their capabilities.\n2. **Operational Impact:**\nThe operational impact of the DHS-2415 use case is that it improves process efficiencies and reduces manual identity verification. The purpose statement mentions that CBP uses facial recognition technology for process efficiency under the Visa Waiver system, using Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) Mobile, and in identifying arriving travelers at airports of entry, using Mobile Passport Control. This allows for more efficient traveler facilitation and reduces manual identity verification, saving time and resources for both the traveler and CBP. The system outputs are not provided in the given scenario; however, it can be assumed that the use case reduces the time taken to verify a traveler's identity, resulting in faster processing times and improved operational efficiencies.\n3. **Transformation Potential:**\nThe transformation potential of the DHS-2415 use case is that it introduces new operational paradigms by enabling biometric matching using facial recognition technology. The use case aligns with traditional workflows of CBP, but it departs from the previous limitations of manual identity verification. By introducing a more efficient and accurate way of verifying a traveler's identity, the use case transforms the operational paradigm of CBP. This transformation has significant implications for future use cases that may leverage facial recognition technology to enhance security and facilitation at borders.\n4. **Risks and Mitigation Strategies:**\nThe potential risks associated with the DHS-2415 use case are ethical concerns, biases, or operational dependencies. Ethical concerns may arise due to privacy issues related to capturing and storing travelers' facial recognition data. To mitigate this risk, CBP can implement strong data protection measures and obtain explicit consent from travelers regarding the collection and use of their data. Biases may occur if the facial recognition technology is not accurate or inclusive enough, leading to disparities in processing times for different groups of travelers. To mitigate this risk, CBP can conduct regular audits and testing of the facial recognition technology to ensure accuracy and fairness. Finally, operational dependencies may arise if the facial recognition technology fails or is unavailable, resulting in delays or additional manual processes. To mitigate this risk, CBP can implement backup systems and contingency plans to ensure continuity of operations.\n5. **Indicators of Value Creation:**\nThe key indicators of value creation for the DHS-2415 use case are improved process efficiencies, reduced manual identity verification, and enhanced traveler facilitation. These indicators can be measured by tracking time savings for travelers and CBP officers, reduction in errors and duplicates, and increase in overall satisfaction levels of travelers. In addition, the use case may also result in implicit value drivers such as improved security through more accurate identity verification and reduced potential for fraud.\n6. **Comparison to Similar Use Cases:**\nThe DHS-2415 use case is similar to other use cases that leverage facial recognition technology for identity verification, such as the FBI's Next Generation Identification (NGI) system and the Department of State's Visa Check program. These use cases share common objectives of improving security and facilitation through faster and more accurate identification of individuals. However, the DHS-2415 use case is unique in its focus on mobile platforms and airport processing, which distinguishes it from other use cases that may primarily focus on criminal investigations or consular services.\n7. **Recommendations for Improvement:**\nSome actionable recommendations to improve the clarity, alignment, and strategic articulation of the DHS-2415 use case are as follows:\n- Provide a more detailed overview of the technology used in the facial recognition system, including any limitations or risks.\n- Include specific performance metrics and targets to measure process efficiencies and traveler satisfaction levels.\n- Conduct regular audits and testing of the facial recognition technology to ensure accuracy and fairness.\n- Develop backup systems and contingency plans to ensure continuity of operations in case of technology failures or unavailability.\n- Consider potential ethical concerns related to data privacy and obtain explicit consent from travelers regarding the collection and use of their data. \nOverall, the DHS-2415 use case has significant potential for improving security and facilitation at borders by leveraging facial recognition technology. However, it is essential to ensure that the system is accurate, fair, and privacy-compliant to mitigate any risks or concerns associated with its implementation."
