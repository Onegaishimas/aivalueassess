ESTA Mobile is an application and screening system used to determine whether citizens and nationals from countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) are eligible to travel to the United States. ESTA Mobile extends the functionality to mobile platforms. The ESTA Mobile application captures a live photo from the traveler to perform a liveness test, and permit CBP\u2019s TVS to conduct a 1-to-1 comparison of the traveler\u2019s captured photo against the traveler\u2019s passport e-Chip photo. ESTA mobile app users may either be an applicant, or third-party affiliates may complete an ESTA authorization on behalf of the traveler. If the ESTA Mobile output does not find liveness or cannot determine an identity match, the application can move forward through the ESTA website, simply treating it as filed by a third-party applicant. Mobile Passport Control captures lives photos of a traveler to permit CBP\u2019s TVS to compare the photo to verified identifies compiled in flight galleries. This allows traveler to verify their identity using their mobile device.

These malware samples require manual reverse engineering to find actionable insights, such as indications of potential compromise or adversary-operated command and control. This AI capability uses deep learning to assist CISA analysts with understanding the content of malware samples, automating tasks such as triage and indicator extraction. This improves internal government tools for reverse engineering of malware, speeding the development of cyber threat intelligence that can be shared across the government and with CISA partners.  \n\nBy enhancing the analysis and generation of shareable cyber threat intelligence, CISA forces threat actors to spend more resources generating new malware.  A report is generated from malware samples submitted to the analysis pipeline, which is then used by human analysts to facilitate the malware triage process. Additional recommendations are displayed via plugins to reverse engineering tools. \n- Benefit Statement: This use case delivers improved internal government tools for reverse engineering of malware and speeding the development of cyber threat intelligence that can be shared across the government and with CISA partners.  Threat actors can leverage the same malware for long periods of time, so having the ability to improve analysis and generation of shareable cyber threat intelligence forces threat actors to spend more resources generating new malware.

RGO reviews satellite, aerial, and radar imagery to expedite damage assessments in the aftermath of a disaster. RGO is utilizing several AI techniques, including computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning, to help prioritize imagery exploitation by identifying areas likely having damage or debris. Areas indicated as likely having damage or debris are prioritized for imagery exploitation by analysts, reducing the time required for visual damage assessments. FEMA will integrate these automated tools for imagery-based damage assessments into RGO processes and systems to inform FEMA geospatial analysts. FEMA geospatial analysts will review output and develop recommendations, so FEMA can quickly detect and characterize damaged and undamaged buildings, identify concentrations of damage, detect debris, and support rapid response and recovery activities. AI models generate points or polygons over areas where damage or debris is likely. This output is a recommendation meant to trigger investigation by human analysts via traditional damage assessments. In large-scale incidents, imagery collection can be comprised of hundreds of thousands of miles of land and millions of structures. AI automation allows for the prioritization of imagery exploitation where damage is likely to have occurred, reducing the time required to identify impacts and summarize damage sustained. \n- Benefit Statement: We will integrate these automated tools for imagery-based damage assessments into RGO processes and systems to inform FEMA geospatial analysts.

This requires the investigation of tens of thousands of emails to determine if there were any signs of compromise or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage. \n\nThe use case was developed to assist ICE Security Operations Center (SOC) in reviewing a collection of emails between ICE personnel and Microsoft that were part of ED 24-02.\u202f It provides a faster mechanism for SOC analysts to determine indicators of compromise, reducing the level of effort for these individuals\u2019 analysis exponentially.\u202f To assist the analysts, Named Entity Recognition (NER) was used to detect PII and other associated keywords while a locally running Large Language Model (LLM), with no external connections, answers questions about selected emails.\u202f The LLM also answers preset questions formulated from Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The analysts use the outputs to expedite the detection of PII and key language within emails, reducing the time needed to analyze the total collection of emails.\u202f If the use case detects PII or key language, then those emails are ranked as higher risk and prioritized by the analyst. The analyst then inspects the email at that location for presence of the data and logs it manually allowing for specified actions based on the results of the analysts\u2019 review.\u202f Ultimately, all emails are manually inspected and depending on the circumstance of the investigation the ICE Privacy Office may be contacted notifying them of the PII that was exposed, or the analyst will provide the information to the SOC Leadership to initiate the incident response process to perform remediation actions needed.\u202f The use case only provides ranking for prioritized processing to the SOC analysts. \n- Benefit Statement: The use case was developed to assist ICE SOC in reviewing a collection of emails between ICE personnel and Microsoft that were part of ED 24-02.  The use case provides a faster mechanism to the SOC analysts to determine indicators of compromise, reducing the level of effort for these individuals\u2019 analysis exponentially.  To assist the analysts, Named Entity Recognition (NER) was used to detect PII and other associated keywords to increase analyst productivity, and reduce time required to analyze emails.\n\n- System Outputs: Not provided\n</use_case>\n\nAddress the following key areas in your response:\nAA. **Named Entity Relationships**: Extract named entities in <use_case>.

Unlike facial identification or recognition, the facial verification function uses a one-to-one matching approach of the individual presenting to the Monitoring App during their check-in by comparing it against the ATD participant\u2019s photograph captured upon enrollment to determine whether the person is who they declare themselves to be. The Monitoring App can be launched from either an ICE ATD-issued mobile device or from the participant\u2019s personal mobile device.  It takes a series of photos of the participant during enrollment, which are stored in the ISAP ATD case management system. During subsequently checks in, an automatic 1:1 verification image of the individual in front of the phone\u2019s camera is matched against the stored profile images to enable the ICE ATD Case Manager to verify the participant\u2019s identity, using a proprietary algorithm. The technology also recognizes if a \u201clive\u201d person is in front of the camera, as opposed to a representation or image of a person. There is a visual ICE ATD Case Manager review if there is no match or if the matching attempt generates an error alert. The photos are only used for the described verification purpose and are not shared for any other purpose or with any other entity or database. Any pictures taken during the facial template capture are immediately deleted from the device and only the facial measurements are captured. \n\nThe ISAP Biometric Monitoring App is a technology option that allows participants to report in using a smartphone. This app verifies a participant\u2019s identity, determines their location, and quickly collects status change information. It adds functionality not available with telephonic methods and is less intrusive than a global positioning system unit. The ISAP Monitoring App limits in-person interactions for routine check-ins, allowing more time to be allocated to non-compliant participants, complex removal proceedings cases, and docket management. \n\nThere are two outputs related to using ISAP Biometric Monitoring App: either a participant passes the biometric match, or the photo is moved to a pending review status.   \n- Benefit Statement: ISAP Biometric Monitoring App is a technology option that allows participants to report in using a smartphone.

Once individuals are in the ATD-ISAP program, officers periodically perform case reviews to determine if current levels of case management and technology assignment are appropriate for the noncitizen in the program or if they need to be adjusted. During the case review, the officer will consider numerous factors to include, but not limited to, current immigration status, supervision and compliance history, pending benefits, being a care giver or care provider, current immigration stage, pending criminal history and/or convictions, the hurricane score, and other factors. The factor known as the Hurricane Score is a quasi-binomial, binary classification machine learning (ML) model that is given information by an analyst that is known about an individual (factors from case management details and participant actions) and determines the probability that the individual will abscond based on absconding patterns the model has learned from inactive ATD-ISAP case data. The model returns a score from 1-5, with the higher number equating to a higher risk. The officer may use this score as one of the many factors previously described when deciding the appropriate level of case management and technology for noncitizens enrolled in the ATD-ISAP program. Because the hurricane score can quickly evaluate an enormous amount of information on thousands of noncitizens in the ATD-ISAP program, it provides officers with additional insight that they would not have otherwise had when performing a case review. \n- Benefit Statement: The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) division would like to explore technology that could help lead to time savings and eliminate human error due to overburdened officers.  An AI generated hurricane score could also minimize the risk that a factor is overlooked due to officers being overburdened.  The hurricane score may be one factor that is used to inform the decision-making process. The \u201cHurricane Score\u201d models the potential risk (1-5) that a noncitizen who is released from detention with the requirement to check in with ICE through monitoring will abscond from the program, with a higher number indicating a higher risk of absconding.\n- System Outputs: Not provided\n</use_case>\n\nAddress the following key areas in your response:\nAA. **Named Entity Relationships**: Extract named entities in <use_case>.

The ICE Check-In application is a mobile application where low-risk adult noncitizens can check-in using location and photo capabilities on user owned mobile devices (iOS and Android application stores). The Check-In App is an opt-in capability that allows for low-risk adult noncitizens to securely check-in via an ICE Verified user account, verify their identity, identify their location, and satisfy check-in requirements thereby reducing in-person office visits and reducing manual processing work. The app requires users to follow several randomly prompted actions and leverages programmatic logic-based heuristics to infer liveness based upon facial-tracking feedback from user interaction. AI and machine learning (ML) are used for this face detection and tracking. Once captured, the photo is verified with a 1:1 verification using the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Traveler Verification Service. Verification of all requirements will satisfy check-in requirements. A failed verification will result in a review by an officer. The officer can request the user try again or request the user use the default in-person check-in process by making an appointment with their local ICE office. AI-enabled capabilities within the ICE Check-In application give ICE the ability to scale its interactions to a greater number of noncitizens and reduce in-office presence at ICE facilities. \n- Benefit Statement: The Check-In App is an opt-in capability that allows for low-risk adult noncitizens to securely check-in via an ICE Verified user account, verify their identity, identify their location, and satisfy check-in requirements thereby reducing in-person office visits and reducing manual processing work.

This tool, intended for non-critical conversations, will supplement existing language services contracts by providing real-time capabilities during various touch points in the ICE process. ERO personnel, who regularly interact with individuals who speak little or no English, currently rely on professional interpretation and translation services, which can be slow to secure. The new machine learning (ML) solution aims to facilitate informal communication quickly and efficiently. When deployed, it will not be used alone for materials vital to an individual\u2019s rights or benefits, or when the source materials contain non-literal language, lack clear grammar, or are overly complex.  In such cases, ERO personnel must seek additional language assistance via bilingual staff or professional language lines. \n\nThe initiative, first spearheaded by the U.S. Coast Guard for maritime usage with support from the DHS Science and Technology Directorate through the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), received Fiscal Year 2022 funding for proof of concept. Solutions, in the form of mobile phone applications, are being developed under research and development phases and are projected to meet ERO\u2019s requirements by January 2026. The Machine Learning Translation Technology Initiative will offer real-time communication and translation services, providing voice-to-text, text-to-voice, and voice-to-voice translations in at least 21 languages. This technology will enhance the ability of ICE ERO personnel to provide meaningful access to programs and services for limited English proficient (LEP) noncitizens. \n- Benefit Statement: The solution will be used to facilitate non-critical communications only. When deployed to production, the solution should not be used alone, absent human quality control, when materials are vital to an individual\u2019s rights or benefits, or when the source materials contain non-literal language (e.g., slang, metaphor), lack clear grammar or structure, contain abbreviations or acronyms, or are overly complex, technical, or wordy. If any interactions indicate the presence of legal or medical issues or a need for greater accuracy, ERO personnel are required to seek additional language assistance via bilingual staff or a professional language line. The solution was first spearheaded by U.S. Coast Guard for maritime usage with the support of DHS Science and Technology Directorate through the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP). ICE ERO received FY22 funding to initiate the proof of concept with the vendors vetted by USCG and DHS S&T through an interagency agreement.

SEVP is responsible for a wide variety of functions focusing on visa holders including F and M nonimmigrants and schools certified to admit them. The SEVP Regulation and Guidance Team performs research on large volumes of immigration policies, regulations, and other guidance for nonimmigrants to generate responses to data calls and queries from schools and students. Current methods for generating responses are manual and time-intensive. SEVP plans to leverage AI by developing a semantic search and LLM-based summarization tool using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to allow policy analysts to research and generate an initial analysis of applicable material more quickly and effectively. The generated output will be used as a starting point to assist policy analysts in completing their tasks, who will further refine, modify, vet, and review the response as part of their process. The source information provided to the tool is either in the public domain or is internal, non-sensitive data, with no Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII), Personally Identifiable Information (PII), nor Security Sensitive Information (SSI) used. This enhanced search capability will save hours of manual work per request, allowing analysts to respond more quickly with the most relevant information and focus on more complex policy and guidance issues. \n- Benefit Statement: The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) uses AI to help policy analysts quickly find and summarize information about visa rules for students and schools.

HSI\u2019s mission is to protect the United States from transnational crime and terrorism by disrupting organizations involved in human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, cybercrime, and other illicit activities. HSI relies on advanced technologies to analyze and process vast amounts of data, including audio and video evidence. Effective investigations depend on the ability to extract relevant information quickly and accurately from large volumes of unstructured reports. Traditional lexical search methods often fall short in this regard. Semantic Search and Summarization technology bridges this gap by leveraging large language models (LLM) to allow investigators to submit natural language queries.  These queries are analyzed to identify the most relevant information in reports, accelerating investigative analysis by rapidly identifying persons of interest, surfacing trends, and detecting networks or fraud. Furthermore, the system allows investigators to build reports by entering raw notes and leveraging LLM to generate a draft report that adheres to the Report of Investigation (ROI) manual's formatting and style guidelines. This saves time and produces more articulate and accurate reports. Once reviewed, validated, and approved by supervisors, the final report is uploaded to a case management system. HSI uses this tool to generate leads, with further action required by investigators and analysts as part of the full investigative process before any action is taken against an individual.\n- Benefit Statement: Effective investigations require querying large volumes of unstructured reports to extract and summarize contextually-relevant information. Current lexical search methods are insufficient for finding such information.

To provide faster answers, SEVP uses a chatbot named SEVIS Interactive Dialog (SID) to handle common questions from students and officials. If SID cannot help, it connects the caller to a human agent and shares the conversation to save time. Callers include visa holders (F, M, and J nonimmigrants), school and program officials, government users, and members of the public. Many questions are routine inquiries about established policies and procedures. SID is a conversational chatbot that uses voice recognition and Natural Language Understanding to understand and reply to users\u2019 questions with scripted answers. SID is deterministic and does not use generative AI. It answers frequently asked questions but SEVP will not be programmed SID to answer safety- and/or rights-impacting questions. If SID cannot answer a question, it transfers the caller to an agent in the response center. The chatbot captures the interaction with the caller and sends the information via an API to Student and Exchange Visitor Program Automated Management System (SEVPAMS). SEVPAMS creates a tickets, either for calls completed by SID or those handed over to an agent. This allows agents to see the dialog between SID and the caller, reducing the need to repeat information. This frees up the human agents to handle  more complex cases and specific record issues.\n- Benefit Statement: AI provides SID the ability to understand voices and its deterministic question and answer workflow (1) enables SID to answer routine caller questions without a help desk agent, and (2) when a help desk agent is required, SID will create a ticket with a caller transcript to reduce the burden on the agent.

The map can be modified to view different health security layers and zoomed in/out to locations of interest. The second approach (MedINT Canvas) is to build a data visualization of interest by selecting topics, such as a disease, symptom, and location, and then observing if and how these topics connect through recent health security events. AI/ML will make this project possible by streamlining the pull of openly available online data into a machine-readable dataset. AI/ML will also support the MedINT Canvas visuals by finding relevant terms in online articles, labeling articles accordingly, and ranking them for relevance to topics of interest.

The SPV Safety Task Force leveraged machine learning (ML) and subject matter expert (SME) input to create an adaptable, quantitative analysis tool that reliably identifies the key drivers of marine casualties and calculates a risk score for each vessel within the largest segment of the U.S.-inspected fleet. A vessel risk score is computed with an analytic model that leverages logistic regression and basic ML. The risk score is then combined with an SME-derived consequence score that considers the number of vessel passengers and operation distance from shore. The final combined number is used to categorize a vessel into one of three tiers: at the lowest risk tier, vessels will receive, at a minimum, mandated inspections as per Title 46 Code of Federal Regulations, while vessels in tiers 2 and 1 may receive more frequent or more thorough inspections by more experienced inspectors. Before an inspection recommendation is communicated to the vessel owner, an SME reviews and approves the vessel scores. Follow-on policy efforts set the required scope and frequency of inspection, the minimum competency of the lead inspector, and the level of accountability for each vessel. In addition to their modeling and policy efforts, this team conducted extensive education and outreach with the field, district, and area commands to aid adoption and foster implementation. Their efforts directly improved marine inspector allocation, targeted risk, and enhanced the governance necessary to increase passenger safety across the country. \n- Benefit Statement: The Small Passenger Vessels (SPV) Safety Task Force leveraged machine learning and subject matter expert input to create an adaptable, quantitative analysis tool that reliably identifies the key drivers of marine casualties and calculates a risk score for each vessel within the largest segment of the U.S.-inspected fleet.

The use case output draws from FBI Background Check System (BCS) source information and is provided to USCIS officers to consider during case processing. For aliases, this solution uses a named-entity recognition (NER) model trained to understand the specific context around where aliases appear\u2014meaning it\u2019s effective at locating true aliases, while at the same time avoiding other places where proper names may exist but are not aliases (e.g., county or street names). For DOBs, this solution uses pattern matching and conditional logic to harvest valid birth dates, while weeding out obvious placeholders and other non-birth dates found within the IdHS text.  This use case has been in production since 2022 and is enabled only for N400. The solution was developed as a Python library, and the encasing Flask application runs on Amazon EKS. Its primary function is to predict where aliases and dates of birth appear within unstructured IdHS text.  It uses a named-entity recognition (NER) model, trained using Spark NLP with a TensorFlow back end on thousands of systematically labeled IdHS records, and word-level embeddings. \n\nThis use case reduces the amount of adjudicative time spent manually harvesting aliases and dates of birth (DOBs) from identity history summary (IdHS) report attached to the ELIS case as part of the Manual Name Harvesting Task during case processing. \n\nEliminates need for manual review by extracting unique names and DOBs from IdHS documents and when names/DOBs are already in ELIS, ANH will not suggest any names.

BET is integrated with the National Appointment Scheduling System (NASS) and the Customer Profile Management System (CPMS). This improves data integrity as BET utilizes data already collected in USCIS systems, reducing the amount of data entry by the Biometric Technician and the risk of typographic errors. BET assists in determining if the fingerprint taken is good enough quality to pass the FBI fingerprint check process.

As an applicant, I want my fingerprints to be accurately collected and compared so that unnecessary appointments can be eliminated.\n  \n**01. Categorization of Value Creation:**\nThis use case can be categorized as an Efficiency Amplifier. BET's integration with existing USCIS systems reduces data entry, and its predictive model identifies low-quality fingerprints that are likely to be rejected by the FBI. This pre-assessment lowers the number of recaptures and subsequent appointments, resulting in time and resources saved.\n\n**02. Operational Impact:**\nBET's operating model can dramatically improve the efficiency of the biometric data collection process by reducing data entry, minimising the risk of typographical errors, eliminating unnecessary reappointments, and increasing successful FBI submissions. \n\n**03. Transformation Potential:**\nBET transforms the data collection process by automating aspects that were traditionally manually operated. The agents not having to manually verify the quality of the fingerprints can be considered a significant operational departure.\n\n**04. Risks and Mitigation Strategies:**\nPossible risks could include the accuracy of the machine learning models used in BET. Incorrectly flagging good quality fingerprints could increase, rather than decrease, the number of recaptures, leading to inefficiencies. Regular auditing of the model, combined with continuous improvement approaches could mitigate this risk.\n\n**05. Indicators of Value Creation:**\nExplicit value is seen through the reduction of rejected submissions and the decrease in manual data entry, resulting in time and resource savings. Implicit value comes from the improved customer experience, as applicants are less likely to need multiple appointments due to fingerprint recapture.\n\n**06.

In addition, the FDNS Directorate is responsible for detecting, deterring, and combating immigration benefit fraud.  In 2005, USCIS developed a case management system, the Fraud Detection and National Security-Data System (FDNS-DS), to record, track, and manage the screening processes related to immigration applications, petitions, or requests with suspected or confirmed fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, and to identify vulnerabilities that may compromise the integrity of the legal immigration system.  In June 2023, FDNS-DS was replaced with a modernized case management system, FDNS-DS NexGen.  In the future, FDNS-DS NexGen may use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) data from other applications to aid in investigative work, enhance investigative case prioritization, and detect duplicate case work. USCIS may also integrate AI/ML into the predictive modeling for future system enhancements, working side-by-side with the business stakeholders to develop best practices.

This helps ensure photos are correct before making ID cards, saving time and avoiding delays. USCIS is the component within DHS that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. USCIS receives immigration requests from individuals seeking immigration and non-immigration benefits. Once a benefit request form is submitted to USCIS, a series of processing and adjudication actions occur. One of the case management systems used to track and adjudicate certain immigration request forms is the Electronic Information System (ELIS). USCIS ELIS is an internal case management system composed of microservices to assist with performing complex adjudicative and processing tasks; one of those microservices is the Photo Validation Service. The card photo validation solution was originally designed for e-filed I-765 (c)(3)s \u2014 to be in direct support of the beneficiary as they apply via myUSCIS. In enabling e-filing for the (c)(3)s, one goal was to have everything captured digitally, including these ID photos, all while avoiding any new delays or complications for the applicant in the process. In other words, if we observed an issue with a photo upon upload, we wanted to address it up front \u2014 rather than waiting until a failed card production sequence.  Because the photo requirements themselves are fixed, this exact same functionality could also be plugged directly into ELIS, just prior to card production. As of late October 2021, an effort to do exactly this is underway. The primary difference is that an adjudicator would explicitly request that a case\u2019s photo be validated, and if applicable, the service would return a recommendation to edit the photo before submission. \n\nThe photo validation service uses a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning models to validate photographs and ensure they meet the requirements, so these photographs can be used in card production. The output is Response back to user based on the pre-defined quality checks if the uploaded photo meets USCIS requirements. Users still have the option to ignore the warnings and upload the photo. \n- Benefit Statement: USCIS uses a system called ELIS to manage immigration requests, and it includes a Photo Validation Service to check if ID photos meet requirements.

The underlying immigrant petition defines if the I-485 is employment-based or family-based. It also has information about the visa classification and priority date which, when compared against the Department of State\u2019s monthly Visa Bulletin, helps predict visa usage. It is difficult to match an I-485 to its underlying immigrant petition, because the only available field on which to match is the Alien-number (A-number). This number is not always present on the immigrant petition, and name/date of birth matching is not as reliable.  The goal of I-485 Family Matching is to leverage AI to create connections more confidently between petitioners and their families based on limited data.  Additionally, it was intended to help identify and group I485s filed by family members, as well as gather up the many ancillary forms they may have been pending (such as I765, I131). Similar to immigrant petition matching, it can be difficult to match up I485s filed by family members. In these cases, the only similar fields are a common address. Efforts have been made in the past to identify family members by address, but it is effective only to a point. This use case explored the technical feasibility of using an AI model to help make working with this data more reliable (as well as group individual petitioners, their families, and other helpful associated data together for faster and more accurate processing).

The de-duplication model ingests person-centric datasets from various source systems for model training and evaluation purposes. Our dataset includes biographic information (e.g., name, date of birth, alien number Social Security Number, passport number) as well as biographic information (e.g., fingerprint IDs, eye color, hair color, height, weight) for model training and matching purposes. Critical to the success of PCIS is the entity resolution and de-deduplication of individual records from various systems of records to create a complete picture of a person. Using machine learning (ML), the model can identify which case management records belong to the same unique individual with a high degree of confidence. This allows PCIS to compile a full immigration history for an individual without the need for time-consuming research across multiple disparate systems. The de-duplication model plays a critical role in the entity resolution and surfacing of a person and all their associated records. The ML models are more resilient to fuzzy matches and handle varying data fill rates more reliably. \n\nUsing Machine Learning allows us to improve entity resolution as compared to rule-based system. PCIS offers the ability to see a person's immigration history organized in one place. Specific benefits do or will include: an organized summary view of the identity with the individual's latest photo from PCIS; full immigration history including receipts associated with the applicant, regardless of case management system; mailing, physical, and safe history of the individual organized in reverse chronological order, allowing users to easily find the most recent address; all identifiers associated with the applicant, including Alien number, Social Security Number, passport number, etc.; and a numerical likelihood score which is used to determine if the record belongs to the individual, subjected to a high threshold (.98, maximum 1) to assess whether the record belongs to the individual. \n- Benefit Statement: Using Machine Learning allows us to improve entity resolution as compared to rule based system.\n\nPCIS offers the ability to see a person's immigration history organized in one place.

This supports two key USCIS Verification Division (VER) programs: the Employment Verification Program (E-Verify) and the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program.  The model streamlines verification data integration services by providing a ranked order of the best matches, expressed as confidence scores, between the identifiers used by the two programs. These improved matches increase the accuracy of E-Verify and SAVE, ensuring they use the most recent and accurate documents to determine benefit status. E-Verify handles approximately 250,000 requests per day and SAVE handles approximately 70,000 requests per day. Multiple data verification models for SAVE and E-Verify exist, complicating efficiency and performance. By consolidating these into a single, unified Verification Match Model within a separate microservice, the use case aims to improve the accuracy of responses and reduce the need for manual review. ML plays a key role in the continuous improvement of these models, ultimately reducing the need for manual case reviews. \n\nLeveraging AI in the USCIS verification matching process of known records across systems is beneficial because it streamlines existing USCIS reviews by 1) improving system accuracy, 2) reducing human error through automated person-and-record match scoring, and 3) handling a higher volume of matches than traditional tools or manual processes can achieve.  The ouput is a recommendation and score indicating person-and-record match probability, used by verification systems (E-verify and SAVE) to improve accuracy in initial system responses. \n- Benefit Statement: Leveraging AI in the USCIS verification matching process of known records across systems is beneficial because it streamlines existing USCIS review by 1) improving associated system accuracy, 2) reducing human-error by automating person-and-record match scoring, and 3) matching at a higher volume than traditional tools or manual processes can capably achieve.\n- System Outputs: Not provided\n</use_case>\n\nAddress the following key areas in your response:\nAA. **Named Entity Relationships**: Extract named entities in <use_case>.

Instead of multiple models and a manual process, we have a unified model that increases accuracy and handles higher volumes. This shift from traditional manual operations to automated matching signifies a significant transformation in USCIS's operational workflow.\n\n04. **Risks and Mitigation Strategies**: Potential risks include biased or inaccurate data resulting in erroneous machine learning outputs. Mitigation strategies would include continuous monitoring and adjustment of the ML model, ensuring diverse and accurate data feeding into the system, and maintaining a backup manual review system.\n\n05. **Indicators of Value Creation**: Key indicators could include an increase in the number of requests handled per day, a decrease in error rates, or a reduction in the requirement of manual review. These reflect operational efficiency, which is an explicit value driver. Implicitly, it could lead to faster processing times for individuals, leading to societal benefits.\n\n06. **Comparison to Similar Use Cases**: Similar use cases can be found in other Government departments where machine learning is used to handle high volumes of data verification and matching. Key differences would include the specific data sets used and the operational contexts.\n\n07. **Recommendations for Improvement**: As system outputs are not provided in the use case, one recommendation would be to include these for clarity. Further, if there are specific challenges the system faced or benefits they realized in implementation, these experiences can be shared for future utility."
