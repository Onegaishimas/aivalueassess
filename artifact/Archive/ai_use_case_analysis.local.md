Subject-verb agreements and pronoun usage indicate key sentences structures within the text. The use case summary explicitly notes the benefits of enhancing available libraries of true positives and normal scans from CBP NII systems to support the development of AI/ML-based anomaly detection algorithms for narcotics and other contraband. However, no explicit goals or constraints are explicitly defined in the text. Therefore, any dependencies highlighted would be assumptions based on established patterns in similar use cases and require further information for completeness.

### **C. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**
Based on the text, possible functional requirements and non-functional requirements are listed below:
| ID | Type | Description | Rationale | Dependencies |
|---|--------------------|-------------|---|--|
| 1 | Functional | Process synthetic image generation and virtual 3D asset creation | To enable more capable and ethical AI when detecting anomalies in complex environments. The availability of rare event/outlier data or labeled data that can be used to train and automate detection is severely limited. | This requirement depends on the availability of NII systems already in place for CBP operations and the development of AI-based anomaly detection algorithms for these systems. | 
| 2 | Non-Functional | Ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness of synthetic images | To achieve more capable and ethical AI when detecting anomalies in complex environments. Inaccurate or incomplete synthetic images may lead to false positives or negatives in detection algorithms. | This requirement depends on the availability of true positives and normal scans from CBP NII systems to generate realistic synthetic images. |
Value categorization is not possible without further context or information about the use case's performance metrics, operational impact, and transformation. Therefore, value-based criteria need to be established based on established patterns in similar use cases and require further information for completeness. 

### **D. Value Categorization**
Based on possible functional and non-functional requirements identified earlier, the following value categorizations can be made:
| Value Types | Description | Rationale |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| Efficiency Amplifier | Use cases that enable operations that were previously constrained by resource or technical limitations. | The use case focuses on generating synthetic images and virtual 3D assets to enhance the performance of existing anomaly detection algorithms for narcotics and other contraband in conveyances and cargo within CBP environments.

| Breakthrough Enabler | Use cases that achieve novel outcomes, redefine operational paradigms, or transcend traditional limitations entirely. | The use case focuses on generating synthetic images and virtual 3D assets to enhance the performance of AI/ML-based anomaly detection algorithms for narcotics and other contraband in conveyances and cargo within CBP environments. Therefore, this use case can be classified as a 'breakthrough enabler' since it introduces new paradigms in detecting anomalies in complex environments that were previously unattainable. |
Value categorization for the use case is not possible without further information about performance metrics, operational impact, and transformation. Therefore, value-based criteria need to be established based on established patterns in similar use cases and require further information for completeness. 

### **E. Performance Metrics**
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) are not explicitly defined in the text. However, these metrics can be inferred from the use case's goal to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection algorithms for narcotics and other contraband in complex environments within CBP operations. Therefore, possible performance metrics for this use case could be:
- Accuracy: The proportion of synthetic images that match real target images
- Precision: The proportion of true positives among all positive detections made by the algorithm
- Recall: The proportion of true positives detected by the algorithm among all actual positive targets in the dataset
- F1 score: A weighted average of precision and recall values, with a higher value indicating better performance
- AUC: A measure of the overall performance of the algorithm across different threshold settings, with a higher value indicating better performance.
However, these assumptions about possible metrics require further information about the use case's operational impact and transformation to confirm their relevance and feasibility. Therefore, value-based criteria need to be established based on established patterns in similar use cases and require further information for completeness.

### Response

### **A. Named Entity Relationships**
* **PERSON**: There are no mentioned entities related to individuals or roles within the given AI use case.
* **ORGANIZATION**: The mentioned organization is Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Its bureau/department CBP is also considered as an entity within this context.
* **LOCATION**: The use case mentions remote locations, presumably referring to areas near the U.S. border. These regions are not specified, but they can be inferred from their relevance to DHS's mission of securing borders.
* **DATE**: There is no mention of specific timeframes in the given AI use case.

### **B. Dependency Parsing and Analysis**
The Purpose Statement and Benefit Statement contain simple, declarative sentences that do not require complex analysis into dependency labels or structures. The System Outputs section lists entities but does not provide structure for dependencies or relationships. As such, there are no meaningful information to extract based on parsing and analysis under this category.

### **C. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**
Based on the given use case, the following functional requirements can be identified:
- **ID 1**: Capture images of cross-border traffic in remote locations.
- **ID 2**: Process captured images using Artificial Intelligence algorithms to detect and track vehicles.
- **ID 3**: Determine vehicle direction at intersections.
- **ID 4**: Provide imagery sufficient for re-identification.

The non-functional requirements in this use case include performance, scalability, accuracy, and reliability. These constraints are implied by the need to detect and track objects covertly, accurately, and reliably in remote locations. The following table summarizes these requirements with their respective rationales:
| **ID** | **Type** | **Description** | **Rationale** | **Dependencies** | 
|------|---------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| ID1 | Functional | Capture images of vehicles at intersections. | Vehicle detection and identification are critical functions that enable DHS's core missions of border security and law enforcement. | **Implicity dependent on other functional requirements related to image processing and vehicle direction determination.** |
| ID2 | Functional | Process captured images using Artificial Intelligence algorithms to detect and track vehicles. | These algorithms must be capable of detecting, identifying, and tracking vehicles accurately enough to support DHS's investigative and enforcement work. The AI system should be able to handle large volumes of data in real-time or near real-time. | **Dependent on quality of sensor kits deployed in remote locations and accuracy of direction determination** |
| ID3 | Functional | Determine vehicle direction at intersections | Direction determination is crucial for identifying the types of vehicles crossing and tracking their movements. The system must be able to accurately determine the direction of travel and detect when a vehicle changes direction. | **Dependent on accuracy of image processing and AI algorithms** |
| ID4 | Functional | Provide imagery sufficient for re-identification | This capability allows DHS agents to identify, track, and investigate vehicles that pose a potential threat to national security or commit crimes against America's borders. | **Dependent on quality of sensors deployed in remote locations and accuracy of vehicle direction determination** |
| ND5 | Non-Functional | Processing speed | The system must be able to process large volumes of data quickly enough to support DHS's real-time investigative and enforcement efforts. Performance constraints must be carefully balanced with scalability considerations to ensure the system can handle a range of data volumes at once. | **Dependent on quality of sensors deployed in remote locations and accuracy of vehicle direction determination** |
| ND5 | Non-Functional | Scalability | The system must be designed to expand its coverage and scale as needed to support DHS's core missions effectively. Scalability is closely linked to performance considerations, given the need for high processing speeds across large data volumes in real-time or near-real-time scenarios. | **Dependent on quality of sensors deployed in remote locations and accuracy of vehicle direction determination**|
For this use case, the breakthrough enabler requirement is not applicable as it pertains to advancing DHS's missions beyond current capabilities. However, ID3 and ND5 could be considered as non-functional requirements related to performance enhancements in cross-border surveillance technologies.

### **D. You are an AI system designed to detect and track vehicles crossing the US border covertly. Your sensors are deployed in remote locations near the border. Your image processing algorithms use Artificial Intelligence techniques to differentiate between different types of vehicles, and your direction determination algorithm is accurate enough to identify when a vehicle changes direction. As you process large volumes of data quickly, your scalability constraints limit the range of data volumes that your system can handle at any given time. Based on these requirements, recommend potential design strategies for improving performance and scalability in this cross-border surveillance scenario.**
Based on the identified functional and non-functional requirements, potential design strategies to improve performance and scalability of the AI surveillance system include:
1. Improvements in image processing algorithms to increase accuracy and speed of vehicle detection and identification across larger data volumes.
2. Integration with other sensors or technology to expand range of detection and tracking capabilities, such as thermal imaging or radar systems.
3. Optimization of system architecture and cloud computing to improve scalability and capacity for real-time processing of large amounts of data from multiple sources.
4. Development of predictive analytics tools to anticipate potential border threats and enable proactive interventions by DHS agents.
5. Continuous monitoring, evaluation, and improvement of system performance through feedback mechanisms and user testing to ensure effectiveness and responsiveness in detecting and tracking vehicles crossing the US border covertly.

**Bureau / Department:** CBP

**Use Case Name:** Airship Outpost for Cross Border Conveyance  Identification

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-188
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: CBP
- Purpose Statement: Part of CBP’s mission is the monitoring of cross border activity at and between our nation’s Ports of Entry. This requires maintaining awareness of cross border conveyances such as automobiles, boats, and airplanes. Airship Outpost allows CBP to accurately identify conveyances (aircraft, vessels, automobiles) by ingesting images and then leveraging AI to identify the type of conveyance and to know where to read the alpha numeric values used to identify them (tail number, hull number, license plate). Standards and regulations for the external identification of various types of conveyances vary significantly. For instance, an aircraft tail number, a vessel hull number, and an automobile license plate number. Once a conveyance is identified, the system focuses on the appropriate location to capture the alphanumeric values used for identification. The software then assigns a confidence score to the accuracy of each capture, which is attached to the files transmitted by the array to a database on cross border activity.  AI is solely used to identify the type of conveyance and then document the associated identification number.

**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-2363
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: CBP
- Purpose Statement: CBP is seeking anomaly detection algorithm (ADA) models that can run on U.S. government systems for rapid screening of passenger and cargo vehicles. The desired end state is a suite of algorithms that supports CBP's non-intrusive inspection (NII) image analysis for detecting anomalies and interdicting contraband to assist CBP officers’ image review with specific interest on algorithms that facilitate screening for contraband and anomaly detection in passenger vehicles and cargo conveyances. This solution will assist CBP officers in adjudicating large-scale NII x-ray images. The solution will identify regions of interest within the structure of commercially owned vehicles (COVs) and detect anomalies within these regions. It will place bounding boxes around an anomaly or unidentifiable object(s) within an image or any portion of the image that cannot be identified or explained. The algorithm will support the review and analysis conducted by image analysts during NII x-ray image adjudication, ultimately reducing overall review time for NII images.  It is expected that this will enhance the capability of humans to consistently detect items of interest/concern present (and possibly concealed) in vehicles crossing into the United States and increase clearance rate at border crossings, so that vehicles operating safely and lawfully may pass through the border faster.

### Response

### **A. Named Entity Relationships**
- **PERSON**: DHS (Department of Homeland Security) officers are mentioned as the intended users of the AI system.
- **ORGANIZATION**: CBP (Customs and Border Protection), a government agency within the Department of Homeland Security, is identified as the proposee.
- **LOCATION**: Crossing points for passenger vehicles and cargo conveyances are mentioned as potential locations where the AI system might be used. No specific borders or ports are mentioned.
- **DATE**: The timeframe for implementation is not specified.
### **B. Dependency Parsing and Analysis**
Dependency parsing is beyond the scope of natural language processing capabilities at present. However, I can provide a high-level analysis of the relationships between key phrases in the use case:
- The Purpose Statement mentions that CBP is seeking anomaly detection algorithm models to support non-intrusive inspection image analysis for detecting contraband and anomalies in passenger vehicles and cargo conveyances. This suggests a functional requirement for image processing capabilities.
- The Benefit Statement indicates that the AI system will identify regions of interest within the structure of commercially owned vehicles (COVs) and detect anomalies within these regions, which implies a need for pattern recognition algorithms.
- Neither the Purpose Statement nor the Benefit Statement mention specific timeframes or performance constraints, so it is unclear whether scalability or response time are significant non-functional requirements.
### **C. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**
Based on the use case, I propose the following functional and non-functional requirements:
| ID | Type | Description | Rationale | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | Functional | Enable image processing capabilities for non-intrusive inspection (NII) of passenger vehicles and cargo conveyances. | The system needs to be able to analyze images produced by NII x-ray scanning equipment to detect anomalies and contraband. | Anomaly detection algorithm models, image analysis algorithms |
| F2 | Functional | Identify regions of interest within the structure of COVs and detect anomalies within these regions. | The system needs to be able to focus its analysis on areas of the vehicle where contraband or anomalies are most likely to occur. | Pattern recognition algorithms, image processing capabilities |
| NF1 | Non-Functional | Maintain high accuracy in image analysis despite variability in NII image quality. | Poor image quality can make it difficult for the system to detect anomalies and contraband accurately. | Image preprocessing algorithms, adaptive filtering approaches |
| NF2 | Non-Functional | Reduce overall review time for NII images. | CBP officers need to be able to quickly and efficiently review image analysis results to make informed decisions about the clearance of vehicles crossing into the United States. | System output optimization, anomaly prioritization algorithms |
### **D. Value Categorization**
Based on the type of problems being addressed by the proposed AI system, I would categorize it as a Capability Enhancer, since it introduces new capabilities to enhance the existing workflows for non-intrusive inspection image analysis. 
In particular, the ability to identify regions of interest within the structure of COVs and detect anomalies within these regions goes beyond the scope of traditional NII image analysis techniques. This could be particularly valuable in improving clearance rates at border crossings while maintaining high levels of security and accuracy.
### **E. Operational Impact and Transformation**
The proposed AI system has the potential to improve efficiency within the existing workflows for non-intrusive inspection image analysis by enabling faster and more accurate detection of anomalies and contraband in passenger vehicles and cargo conveyances. This could lead to reduced overall review times for NII images, which could translate into cost savings and improved border crossing times for commercial vehicles.
Moreover, the proposed AI system could also transform the way CBP officers conduct non-intrusive inspection image analysis by enabling them to focus their attention on areas of the vehicle where anomalies are most likely to occur, rather than having to manually analyze every inch of the vehicle for signs of contraband.
### **F. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**
### **G. Value Metrics**
The improved accuracy and efficiency of image analysis provided by the proposed AI system could potentially lead to cost savings for commercial vehicles crossing into the United States, as well as improve border crossing times for these vehicles. Moreover, the ability to detect anomalies and contraband more accurately could help CBP officers to prevent security threats from entering the country, which could have significant societal impacts and value.
Given the potential benefits of the proposed AI system in terms of cost savings, reduced review times, improved border crossing times, increased security, and potentially reduced rates of contraband smuggling, it would be worthwhile for CBP to invest further resources into its development and deployment.

### Response

### **A. Named Entity Relationships**
1. **PERSON**: The Purpose Statement mentions "CBP image analysts during NII x-ray image adjudication" who are individuals performing a specific role. 
2. **ORGANIZATION**: The use case involves multiple agencies, including DHS, CBP, and the Bureau/Department of Homeland Security. 
3. **LOCATION**: The use case mentions border crossings where vehicles are being inspected. 
4. **DATE**: The System Outputs section does not provide any specific timeframes.

### **B. Dependency Parsing and Analysis**
Dependency relationships cannot be accurately determined without a full parse tree or dependency graph, as the text is fairly complex. However, some initial observations can be made:
- There appears to be a causal relationship between the ADA model being sought by CBP and the purpose of rapid screening for passenger and cargo vehicles.
- The phrase "facilitates screening for contraband and anomaly detection" suggests that both functions are dependent on the use of ADA models, and may be mutually reinforcing. 
- The ability to identify "anomalies within homogenous cargo" is also a key dependency between various parts of the system described in the use case.
Note that further analysis would require more extensive parsing and analysis tools than are currently available in this context.

### **C. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**
Based on the information provided in the Purpose Statement and Benefit Statement, potential functional requirements for the AI algorithm solution could include:
- Efficiently identify anomalies within homogenous cargo contained in commercial vehicles.
- Accurately identify and bound contraband or unidentifiable objects within NII x-ray images of passenger and cargo vehicles. 
- Improve overall review time for NII images by CBP image analysts during non-intrusive inspection image adjudication.  
Non-functional requirements could include:
- High scalability to handle large volumes of NII x-ray images.
- Fast processing speed to support real-time analysis of NII images.
- Ease of integration with existing CBP systems and workflows.
Dependencies between these requirements would likely include:
- The ability to accurately identify anomalies within homogenous cargo (Functional Requirement 1) is dependent on the speed and scalability of the ADA algorithm (Non-Functional Requirement 1).
- The ability to bound contraband or unidentifiable objects (Functional Requirement 2) is dependent on the accuracy of the algorithm.

The operational metric this use case can measure is the time saved by CBP agents in reviewing and adjudicating alerts quickly and efficiently, which previously may have been more time-consuming without the software's analysis of imagery. The organizational benefit is that it improves security by detecting people either crossing into the U.S. at a time and place other than designated for entry or those already inside the U.S. trying to elude capture. Finally, the societal impact is that improved border security can deter criminal organizations from smuggling drugs, weapons, or human trafficking victims across the border.

- Purpose Statement: Babel is a commercially procured tool that helps CBP compile social media and open-source information on travelers who may be subject to further screening for potential violation of laws that CBP is authorized to enforce or administer. The tool searches and aggregates open-source information related to manually entered queries, which CBP can review and utilize to identify potential threats to the United States. CBP uses this tool to conduct targeted queries to aid CBP in open source research to monitor potential threats or dangers, or to identify travelers who may be subject to further inspection for violation of relevant laws . Babel utilizes AI modules for text detection and translation as well as object and image recognition to provide analysts with possible matches to manually review in a single interface, versus doing multiple manual queries. The output is not singly used for action or decision making. Rather, it is used to identify additional open source or social media content for a person or to identify additional selectors (such as phone and emails) that are previously unknown to CBP. These selectors are then compared by an analyst against Government systems to identify any additional derogatory information. These factors often eliminate additional screening for the traveler.

- Purpose Statement: CBP uses facial recognition technology for process efficiency under the Visa Waiver system, using Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) Mobile, and in identifying arriving travelers at airports of entry, using Mobile Passport Control. ESTA Mobile is an application and screening system used to determine whether citizens and nationals from countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) are eligible to travel to the United States. ESTA Mobile extends the functionality to mobile platforms. The ESTA Mobile application captures a live photo from the traveler to perform a liveness test, and permit CBP’s TVS to conduct a 1-to-1 comparison of the traveler’s captured photo against the traveler’s passport e-Chip photo. ESTA mobile app users may either be an applicant, or third-party affiliates may complete an ESTA authorization on behalf of the traveler. If the ESTA Mobile output does not find liveness or cannot determine an identity match, the application can move forward through the ESTA website, simply treating it as filed by a third-party applicant. Mobile Passport Control captures lives photos of a traveler to permit CBP’s TVS to compare the photo to verified identifies compiled in flight galleries. This allows traveler to verify their identity using their mobile device. If a traveler is unsuccessful with mobile passport control, the traveler is simply processed in the regular customs line.

## Use Case ID: DHS-2417

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** CBP

**Use Case Name:** Process Efficiency Traveler Identity for Airline Check-in and Bag Drop

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-2417
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: CBP
- Purpose Statement: This use case utilizes facial comparison technology, Traveler Verification Service (TVS), for identity verification at check-in or bags drop for air travel.  For bag drop, the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) has an established process under 49 U.S.C. § 114.1 for carriers to request an alternate procedure for identity verification. For these technical demonstrations, CBP’s TVS may serve as the requested alternate procedure. Air carriers, in voluntary partnership with CBP, may purchase camera equipment in order to capture photos at check-in and again at baggage drop for transmission to CBP. The TVS matching service creates a biometric template of each international traveler’s photo and compares it against templates of existing DHS holdings (i.e., U.S. passports, U.S. visas, and/or other DHS encounters) in order to provide identity verification on behalf of the CBP partner.  In the event of a positive match, the TVS returns a unique identifier and matching results to the air carrier, and the traveler may proceed to finish the check-in/bag drop process. The matching result can be used by airlines (1) to meet their CBP regulatory requirement to verify specific passenger information and (2) their TSA regulatory requirement to accurately verify traveler’s identities. This is a voluntary opt-in process efficiency option provided to travelers.

## Use Case ID: DHS-344

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** CBP

**Use Case Name:** Traveler Verification Service (TVS)

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-344
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: CBP
- Purpose Statement: The Traveler Verification Service (TVS) provides CBP a biometric entry/exit system to record arrivals and departures to and from the United States. CBP uses TVS as its backend matching service for all biometric entry and exit operations that use Facial Comparison. CBP creates localized photo "galleries" from images captured during previous entry inspections, photographs from U.S. passports and U.S. visas, and photographs from other DHS encounters. The images are converted into templates and the actual photograph is discarded. The templates are securely stored, and are what make up the TVS gallery. The templates are then used by the Facial Comparison system to verify a traveler's identity when they arrive or depart the U.S. When the traveler presents him or herself for entry, or for exit, the traveler will encounter a camera connected to TVS. This camera matches live images with the existing photo templates from passenger travel documents. Once the camera captures a quality image and the system successfully matches it with historical photo templates of all travelers from the gallery associated with that particular manifest, the traveler proceeds to inspection for admissibility by a CBP Officer, or exits the United States. For more information, please read the DHS/CBP/PIA-056 - Privacy Impact Assessment for the Traveler Verification Service.

### Response

A. Named Entity Relationships:
1. **PERSON**: Individuals
2. **ORGANIZATION**: DHS, CBP
3. **LOCATION**: Seized Property Vault Activity Automation (SPVAA)
4. **DATE**: None Provided

In the purpose statement "CBP personnel accessing the vault" indicates that individuals will be using the system. The agency and bureau/department are DHS and CBP respectively.

B. Dependency Parsing and Analysis:
There is only one sentence in the proposal, which reads "The system will enhance monitoring and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, contributing to stronger security protocols for handling seized property." The subject of this sentence is the system, and it is modified by several adjectives that express its benefits. There are no clear dependencies or relationships between words in this sentence.

C. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:
There are no explicit functional requirements listed in the use case. However, we can infer that the system must be capable of logging access to a seized property vault, including recording photos of personnel accessing the vault and tracking their activities within the vault. The only non-functional requirement stated is "The system will enhance monitoring", which could be understood as a performance constraint or objective.

D. Value Categorization:
Based on the limited information provided in this use case, it would be difficult to definitively categorize this use case as either an Efficiency Amplifier, Capability Enhancer, or Breakthrough Enabler. There is no mention of any resource constraints or limitations that might prevent CBP from handling seized property effectively. Therefore, it is unclear how much the system will "transcend traditional limitations entirely". 
However, we can say that the purpose statement suggests this use case has the potential to improve monitoring and security protocols for handling seized property. We could speculate that it may potentially enable new capabilities by allowing CBP personnel to more easily track their activities within the vault or make changes to existing workflows related to handling seized property.

E. Operational Impact and Transformation:
The proposal suggests that the system will "enhance monitoring", which could lead to improvements in efficiency and capability for CBP's handling of seized property. The use case also mentions reducing the risk of unauthorized access, which could be seen as a transformative impact on security protocols.

F. Value Metrics:
The proposal does not provide specific information about operational metrics or organizational benefits arising from this use case. It simply states that "the system will enhance monitoring and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, contributing to stronger security protocols for handling seized property." However, we can infer that improvements in efficiency may result from automating certain tasks related to logging access to the vault or tracking individual activities within it. 
Moreover, it is possible that the use case will have societal impacts, such as enhancing overall security and reducing incidents of unauthorized access to seized property storage facilities. Any analysis of value metrics would require more detailed information about operational context and outcomes than is currently provided in this proposal.

- Purpose Statement: Integrated technologies and analytics enhance maritime detection and the sensor network. Machine-assisted and AI-enhanced detection and tracking allow for improved illicit vessel detection in areas with high volumes of legitimate trade and recreational water vessel traffic by increasing situational awareness and responsiveness to threats.  Vessel Detection allows an agent to set a search area with criteria (e.g., people, drones, vehicles) and transmit those criteria to the sensors.  Images detected by the sensors are automatically recognized using Artificial Intelligence. The AI algorithms filter, detect, and recognize objects, dividing them into Items of Interest (IoI) and other objects.  Detections of IoI are shared with other detection systems while detections of other objects (e.g., animals) are not shared. IoIs can be tracked and maintained across multiple sensors seamlessly. 
- Benefit Statement: Current surveillance technology does not have machine assisted classification of targets on screen, making it harder for human operators to decipher legitimate from illegitimate traffic in times of high volumes of legitimate traffic.  Project intends to support human operator identification and classification of potential illicit vessels.  Benefits would be more efficient detection and resolution of IOIs, especially during times of high-volume traffic.

- Bureau / Department: CISA
- Purpose Statement: CISA receives information about computer security vulnerabilities and threats in the form of malicious code samples (malware) from its federal civilian and critical infrastructure partners. These malware samples require manual reverse engineering to find actionable insights, such as indications of potential compromise or adversary-operated command and control. This AI capability uses deep learning to assist CISA analysts with understanding the content of malware samples, automating tasks such as triage and indicator extraction. This improves internal government tools for reverse engineering of malware, speeding the development of cyber threat intelligence that can be shared across the government and with CISA partners.  

By enhancing the analysis and generation of shareable cyber threat intelligence, CISA forces threat actors to spend more resources generating new malware.  A report is generated from malware samples submitted to the analysis pipeline, which is then used by human analysts to facilitate the malware triage process. Additional recommendations are displayed via plugins to reverse engineering tools. 
- Benefit Statement: This use case delivers improved internal government tools for reverse engineering of malware and speeding the development of cyber threat intelligence that can be shared across the government and with CISA partners.

## Use Case ID: DHS-2442

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** FEMA

**Use Case Name:** Digital Processing Procedure Manual (D-PPM)

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-2442
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: FEMA
- Purpose Statement: The Digital Processing Procedures Manual (D-PPM) technology is an AI-based search that will be implemented in call centers and remote field services locations to enhance agent support, encourage proper utilization of guidance and procedures, and ensure a consistent, empathic survivor experience. Leveraging this intelligent retrieval technology does not rely on extensive application changes and offers substantial benefits in providing round-the-clock support while prioritizing complex inquiries. This initiative aims to enhance survivor satisfaction and call center efficiency by reducing call handle times and maintaining or improving answer quality.  The current applications for handling agent inquiries for processing applications are resource-intensive, leading to high operational costs and inefficiencies, especially during peak periods immediately following presidential-declared disasters. Currently, FEMA has a repository on SharePoint called the Processing Procedures Manual (PPM) that houses more than 70 documents that make up over 2,000 pages worth of content and guidance. Agents search this content and guidance with find function and keyword search, first having to find the right document, and then using keyword-based search and find functionality, negatively impacting efficiency and quality and leading to increases in escalations to higher tiers of agents/support who are no longer freed up to work on more complex situations.  Implementation of a 24/7 digital, interactive application will expedite guidance comprehension and discovery to provide better support to disaster survivors during active disasters. The system would use AI and search capabilities to intelligently analyze FEMA policies and guidance and assist the agents through the assistance review and award process.  

The AI will enable agents to retrieve information quickly, reducing the overall time spent on each call.  By providing more accurate and relevant search results, the AI will help agents deliver consistent, correct responses.  Reducing the time spent per call will improve operational efficiency, leading to potential cost savings.  By empowering agents with the correct information, the tool will lower the frequency of escalations to supervisors, allowing them to focus on more complex cases.  The time saved through the AI tool will allow agents to handle more complex queries, ultimately improving service quality and survivor satisfaction.  As the AI tool is rolled out, it will provide a scalable solution that can grow with the agency’s needs during large-scale disaster responses. 
- Benefit Statement: The AI addresses the inefficiency in the current manual search process, where agents spend significant time navigating static documents like PDFs (2000+ pages/70 documents) to answer survivor questions. As policies can change frequently, especially during disasters, it is crucial that agents access the most up-to-date information quickly and accurately.

Expected Benefits and Positive Outcomes:
Faster Response Times: The AI will enable agents to retrieve information quickly, reducing the overall time spent on each call.
Improved Answer Accuracy: By providing more accurate and relevant search results, the AI will help agents deliver consistent, correct responses.
Cost Savings: Reducing the time spent per call will improve operational efficiency, leading to potential cost savings.
Reduced Escalations: By empowering agents with the correct information, the tool will lower the frequency of escalations to supervisors, allowing them to focus on more complex cases.
Increased Capacity for Complex Casework: The time saved through the AI tool will allow agents to handle more complex queries, ultimately improving service quality and survivor satisfaction.
Scalability: As the AI tool is rolled out, it will provide a scalable solution that can grow with the agency’s needs during large-scale disaster responses.

- Bureau / Department: FEMA
- Purpose Statement: The Response Geospatial Office (RGO) is exploring the use of AI to assist in the prioritization of structural and debris assessments. RGO reviews satellite, aerial, and radar imagery to expedite damage assessments in the aftermath of a disaster. RGO is utilizing several AI techniques, including computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning, to help prioritize imagery exploitation by identifying areas likely having damage or debris. Areas indicated as likely having damage or debris are prioritized for imagery exploitation by analysts, reducing the time required for visual damage assessments. FEMA will integrate these automated tools for imagery-based damage assessments into RGO processes and systems to inform FEMA geospatial analysts. FEMA geospatial analysts will review output and develop recommendations, so FEMA can quickly detect and characterize damaged and undamaged buildings, identify concentrations of damage, detect debris, and support rapid response and recovery activities. AI models generate points or polygons over areas where damage or debris is likely. This output is a recommendation meant to trigger investigation by human analysts via traditional damage assessments. In large-scale incidents, imagery collection can be comprised of hundreds of thousands of miles of land and millions of structures. AI automation allows for the prioritization of imagery exploitation where damage is likely to have occurred, reducing the time required to identify impacts and summarize damage sustained. 
- Benefit Statement: We will integrate these automated tools for imagery-based damage assessments into RGO processes and systems to inform FEMA geospatial analysts.

## Use Case ID: DHS-251

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** FEMA

**Use Case Name:** Individual Assistance (IA) & Public Assistance (PA) Projections

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-251
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: FEMA
- Purpose Statement: Individual Assistance (IA) and Public Assistance (PA) Projections predicts recovery program quantities of interest using supervised learning models. These models include, but not limited to, predicting the number of households that will register for the Individuals and Households Program (IHP), the number of households that will require direct housing assistance, the number of temporary transitional housing units needed, the number of applicants for Public Assistance, the number of PA projects that applicants will submit, the number of sites that will need to be inspected per PA project, and the cost of delivering assistance.  Supervised learning models include sample statistics, generalized linear models, decision trees, and deep neural networks. 

The purpose of these supervised learning models is for informational purposes, to produce predictions for to-be-determined quantities of interest and for decisional purposes that may include implicit use (e.g., seeing a large number of households requiring assistance may motivate FEMA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to consider requesting additional funding for the Disaster Relief Fund) or explicit use (e.g., the number of estimated housing units required may be used to determine the number of housing units to order just-in-time). Anticipated benefits of using supervised learning models include increased predictive performance, timely predictions, quantification of uncertainty, and rigor. 

These supervised learning models produce predictions, not recommendations or decisions (though they can inform human users in making recommendations and decisions). At minimum, these models will produce point predictions for the different quantities of interest for disaster declarations. Additionally, they may produce prediction intervals or predictive distributions as feasible and appropriate for the given prediction problem. Often these outputs will be shared via business intelligence tools (e.g., Tableau or PowerBI) for wide internal FEMA use. Some predictions may be shared with a more restricted audience through simpler means (e.g., an excel workbook) as appropriate. 
- Benefit Statement: The purpose of these supervised learning models is two-fold:

1.	For informational purposes: the models will produce predictions for to-be-determined quantities of interest. These quantities are often of interest to Agency personnel in the field, region, and headquarters, as well as DHS, OMB, NSC, and the Whitehouse.
2.	For decisional purposes: in addition to being informative, the model’s predictions are likely to be used for decision making. This may include implicit use (e.g., seeing that there are a large number of households that require assistance may motivate FEMA CFO to consider requesting additional funding for the Disaster Relief Fund) or explicit use (e.g., the number of estimated housing units required may be used to determine the number of housing units to order just-in-time).

Anticipated benefits of using supervised learning models include:
1.	Increased predictive performance: supervised learning models offer means of quantifying and choosing models with the best possible predictive performance.
2.	Timely prediction: supervised learning models can produce reasonably high performance predictions based on limited data.
3.	Quantification of uncertainty: supervised learning models are able to provide prediction intervals and predictive distributions in addition to point predictions to give users a sense of how uncertainty is inherent in the prediction.
4.	Rigor: supervised learning models are well founded on statistical learning theory and provide a level of mathematical rigor that speaks to the reliability and limitations of methods.

## Use Case ID: DHS-2424

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** ICE

**Use Case Name:** AI Assisted Compromise Email Detector (AACED)

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-2424
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: ICE
- Purpose Statement: The AI Assisted Compromise Email Detector (AACED) helps prioritize which emails human security analysts should investigate first to identify cyber compromise ICE. This use case reports AI-enabled analysis on a one-time export of emails between ICE and Microsoft relevant to Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Emergency Directive 24-02. This use case does not perform live email analysis and only includes emails sent to/from ICE email accounts. 

The Information Assurance Division (IAD) within ICE is responsible for providing Cybersecurity Services to ICE, including operating the ICE Security Operations and Computer Security Incident Response Center through its Cyber Defense & Intelligence Branch. The Branch performs information assurance mitigation, responds to (and reports on) Information Technology (IT) security incidents, performs systems vulnerability testing, and monitors and evaluates the security performance on sensitive enterprise systems. CISA published Emergency Directive (ED) 24-02: Mitigating the Significant Risk from Nation-State Compromise of Microsoft Corporate Email System in which all Federal Government Agencies were required to review the stored email metadata from Microsoft to determine if they were affected from the breach. This requires the investigation of tens of thousands of emails to determine if there were any signs of compromise or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage. 

The use case was developed to assist ICE Security Operations Center (SOC) in reviewing a collection of emails between ICE personnel and Microsoft that were part of ED 24-02.  It provides a faster mechanism for SOC analysts to determine indicators of compromise, reducing the level of effort for these individuals’ analysis exponentially.  To assist the analysts, Named Entity Recognition (NER) was used to detect PII and other associated keywords while a locally running Large Language Model (LLM), with no external connections, answers questions about selected emails.  The LLM also answers preset questions formulated from Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The analysts use the outputs to expedite the detection of PII and key language within emails, reducing the time needed to analyze the total collection of emails.  If the use case detects PII or key language, then those emails are ranked as higher risk and prioritized by the analyst. The analyst then inspects the email at that location for presence of the data and logs it manually allowing for specified actions based on the results of the analysts’ review.  Ultimately, all emails are manually inspected and depending on the circumstance of the investigation the ICE Privacy Office may be contacted notifying them of the PII that was exposed, or the analyst will provide the information to the SOC Leadership to initiate the incident response process to perform remediation actions needed.  The use case only provides ranking for prioritized processing to the SOC analysts. 
- Benefit Statement: The use case was developed to assist ICE SOC in reviewing a collection of emails between ICE personnel and Microsoft that were part of ED 24-02.  The use case provides a faster mechanism to the SOC analysts to determine indicators of compromise, reducing the level of effort for these individuals’ analysis exponentially.  To assist the analysts, Named Entity Recognition (NER) was used to detect PII and other associated keywords to increase analyst productivity, and reduce time required to analyze emails.

## Use Case ID: DHS-407

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** ICE

**Use Case Name:** Biometric Check-in for ATD-ISAP (SmartLINK)

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-407
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: ICE
- Purpose Statement: The Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) Monitoring App includes unique facial verification technology that allows participants to capture their photo during ICE Alternatives to Detention (ATD) enrollment for future verification purposes (e.g., during check-in). Unlike facial identification or recognition, the facial verification function uses a one-to-one matching approach of the individual presenting to the Monitoring App during their check-in by comparing it against the ATD participant’s photograph captured upon enrollment to determine whether the person is who they declare themselves to be. The Monitoring App can be launched from either an ICE ATD-issued mobile device or from the participant’s personal mobile device.  It takes a series of photos of the participant during enrollment, which are stored in the ISAP ATD case management system. During subsequently checks in, an automatic 1:1 verification image of the individual in front of the phone’s camera is matched against the stored profile images to enable the ICE ATD Case Manager to verify the participant’s identity, using a proprietary algorithm. The technology also recognizes if a “live” person is in front of the camera, as opposed to a representation or image of a person. There is a visual ICE ATD Case Manager review if there is no match or if the matching attempt generates an error alert. The photos are only used for the described verification purpose and are not shared for any other purpose or with any other entity or database. Any pictures taken during the facial template capture are immediately deleted from the device and only the facial measurements are captured. 

The ISAP Biometric Monitoring App is a technology option that allows participants to report in using a smartphone. This app verifies a participant’s identity, determines their location, and quickly collects status change information. It adds functionality not available with telephonic methods and is less intrusive than a global positioning system unit. The ISAP Monitoring App limits in-person interactions for routine check-ins, allowing more time to be allocated to non-compliant participants, complex removal proceedings cases, and docket management. 

There are two outputs related to using ISAP Biometric Monitoring App: either a participant passes the biometric match, or the photo is moved to a pending review status.   
- Benefit Statement: ISAP Biometric Monitoring App is a technology option that allows participants to report in using a smartphone.

## Use Case ID: DHS-2408

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** ICE

**Use Case Name:** Hurricane Score

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-2408
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: ICE
- Purpose Statement: ICE Enforcement Removal Operations’ Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program exists to ensure compliance with release conditions and provides important case management services for non-detained noncitizens. ATD consists of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), which utilizes case management and technology tools to support noncitizens compliance with release conditions, court hearings, and final orders of removal, while allowing them to remain in their communities as they move through the immigration process or prepare for departure from the United States. Once individuals are in the ATD-ISAP program, officers periodically perform case reviews to determine if current levels of case management and technology assignment are appropriate for the noncitizen in the program or if they need to be adjusted. During the case review, the officer will consider numerous factors to include, but not limited to, current immigration status, supervision and compliance history, pending benefits, being a care giver or care provider, current immigration stage, pending criminal history and/or convictions, the hurricane score, and other factors. The factor known as the Hurricane Score is a quasi-binomial, binary classification machine learning (ML) model that is given information by an analyst that is known about an individual (factors from case management details and participant actions) and determines the probability that the individual will abscond based on absconding patterns the model has learned from inactive ATD-ISAP case data. The model returns a score from 1-5, with the higher number equating to a higher risk. The officer may use this score as one of the many factors previously described when deciding the appropriate level of case management and technology for noncitizens enrolled in the ATD-ISAP program. Because the hurricane score can quickly evaluate an enormous amount of information on thousands of noncitizens in the ATD-ISAP program, it provides officers with additional insight that they would not have otherwise had when performing a case review. 
- Benefit Statement: The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) division would like to explore technology that could help lead to time savings and eliminate human error due to overburdened officers.  An AI generated hurricane score could also minimize the risk that a factor is overlooked due to officers being overburdened.  The hurricane score may be one factor that is used to inform the decision-making process. The “Hurricane Score” models the potential risk (1-5) that a noncitizen who is released from detention with the requirement to check in with ICE through monitoring will abscond from the program, with a higher number indicating a higher risk of absconding.

- Purpose Statement: ICE is authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to set terms of supervision on non-citizens who are in immigration proceedings or who have completed proceedings and were not granted a status or relief of any kind. The ICE Check-In application is a mobile application where low-risk adult noncitizens can check-in using location and photo capabilities on user owned mobile devices (iOS and Android application stores). The Check-In App is an opt-in capability that allows for low-risk adult noncitizens to securely check-in via an ICE Verified user account, verify their identity, identify their location, and satisfy check-in requirements thereby reducing in-person office visits and reducing manual processing work. The app requires users to follow several randomly prompted actions and leverages programmatic logic-based heuristics to infer liveness based upon facial-tracking feedback from user interaction. AI and machine learning (ML) are used for this face detection and tracking. Once captured, the photo is verified with a 1:1 verification using the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Traveler Verification Service. Verification of all requirements will satisfy check-in requirements. A failed verification will result in a review by an officer. The officer can request the user try again or request the user use the default in-person check-in process by making an appointment with their local ICE office. AI-enabled capabilities within the ICE Check-In application give ICE the ability to scale its interactions to a greater number of noncitizens and reduce in-office presence at ICE facilities.

This platform will provide Optical Character Recognition and machine learning models to verify, extract, and classify information from ICE forms such as contract invoices, the Disability Accommodation Notification (DAN) form, Notices to Appear (NTA), email inquiries to the Office of the Inspector General, the Sexual Abuse or Assault Incident Review form, Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) system access requests, the Notice to Student or Exchange Visitor (I-515) form, and the Training Plan for STEM OPT Students (I-983) form. AI is used during these automations to verify and extract information from the forms only and does not change data or make decisions based on the data. Additional workflow automations will use this data for follow-on actions such as processing an invoice, creating a case, or entering data into another system, depending on the purpose of the automation. The platform also includes the ability to create a feedback loop to continuously improve the model's accuracy by retraining it with new, relevant data. Using AI to provide information extraction for these processes saves ICE personnel a significant amount of time while improving data quality and enabling automation.  
- Benefit Statement: Business units within ICE leverage these services to automate repeatable, time-consuming processes such as invoice processing, and form entry validation and extraction.

- Purpose Statement: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is a critical component ofICE, responsible for investigating crimes that threaten national security, public safety, and the economy. HSI’s mission is to protect the United States from transnational crime and terrorism by disrupting organizations involved in human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, cybercrime, and other illicit activities. HSI relies on advanced technologies and innovative solutions to analyze and process vast amounts of data, including audio and video evidence. The sheer volume of data often overwhelms human capabilities, making it challenging for HSI personnel to analyze evidence and identify key players in criminal networks. Currently, there is no effective mechanism to quantify the level of evidence related to a particular subject or entity, or to determine the most influential actors within a network. This is particularly critical in the counter-opioid/fentanyl mission, where timely and accurate intelligence is essential. To address this challenge, HSI has developed a project that uses machine learning (ML) to assign point values to data, enabling the scoring of information associated with a given selector, such as a phone number or legal name. This scoring system helps to understand the importance of an entity to investigations and the potential consequences of removing or neutralizing that entity. By doing so, HSI personnel can focus on high-priority targets and associated criminal networks, enhancing their ability to disrupt and dismantle these threats. HSI uses this tool to generate leads, with further actions taken by investigators and analysts as part of the full investigative process before any action is taken against an individual

## Use Case ID: DHS-197

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** ICE

**Use Case Name:** Machine Learning Translation Technology Initiative

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-197
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: ICE
- Purpose Statement: ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) is developing a real-time translation tool to assist staff in communicating with noncitizens who have limited English proficiency. This tool, intended for non-critical conversations, will supplement existing language services contracts by providing real-time capabilities during various touch points in the ICE process. ERO personnel, who regularly interact with individuals who speak little or no English, currently rely on professional interpretation and translation services, which can be slow to secure. The new machine learning (ML) solution aims to facilitate informal communication quickly and efficiently. When deployed, it will not be used alone for materials vital to an individual’s rights or benefits, or when the source materials contain non-literal language, lack clear grammar, or are overly complex.  In such cases, ERO personnel must seek additional language assistance via bilingual staff or professional language lines. 

The initiative, first spearheaded by the U.S. Coast Guard for maritime usage with support from the DHS Science and Technology Directorate through the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), received Fiscal Year 2022 funding for proof of concept. Solutions, in the form of mobile phone applications, are being developed under research and development phases and are projected to meet ERO’s requirements by January 2026. The Machine Learning Translation Technology Initiative will offer real-time communication and translation services, providing voice-to-text, text-to-voice, and voice-to-voice translations in at least 21 languages. This technology will enhance the ability of ICE ERO personnel to provide meaningful access to programs and services for limited English proficient (LEP) noncitizens. 
- Benefit Statement: The solution will be used to facilitate non-critical communications only. When deployed to production, the solution should not be used alone, absent human quality control, when materials are vital to an individual’s rights or benefits, or when the source materials contain non-literal language (e.g., slang, metaphor), lack clear grammar or structure, contain abbreviations or acronyms, or are overly complex, technical, or wordy. If any interactions indicate the presence of legal or medical issues or a need for greater accuracy, ERO personnel are required to seek additional language assistance via bilingual staff or a professional language line. The solution was first spearheaded by U.S. Coast Guard for maritime usage with the support of DHS Science and Technology Directorate through the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP). ICE ERO received FY22 funding to initiate the proof of concept with the vendors vetted by USCG and DHS S&T through an interagency agreement. Solutions, in the form of mobile phone applications, are being developed under research and development phases and projected to completely meet ERO’s requirements by January 2026.

- Purpose Statement: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is a critical component of ICE, responsible for investigating a wide range of crimes that threaten national security, public safety, and the economy. With a mission to protect the United States from transnational crime and terrorism, HSI works to disrupt and dismantle complex organizations that engage in human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, cybercrime, and other illicit activities. To achieve this mission, HSI relies on advanced technologies and innovative solutions to analyze and process vast amounts of data, including audio and video evidence. Mobile device analytics capabilities were developed to meet the growing need for investigators to quickly and effectively review and analyze the massive amounts of data extracted from mobile devices obtained in court-ordered seizures through a warrant or other investigative due process. The solution empowers investigators and analysts to identify and extract critical evidence, relationships, and networks from mobile device data, leveraging machine learning capabilities to determine locations of interest. Present capabilities are limited to the use of an algorithm for clustering of geo-location data, allowing investigators to identify 'stops' and 'overlaps' of locations from lawfully seized phones, where a 'stop' is a location a phone may have remained for a period and an 'overlap' is a location where multiple phones may have visited. By streamlining the analysis process, these capabilities aim to enhance the efficacy of HSI agents and analysts by providing advanced data processing to identify the most relevant information for lead generation in a shorter amount of time than manually processing, ultimately contributing to the disruption and dismantling of criminal networks and the protection of national security. HSI uses this tool to generate leads, and further action is required by investigators and analysts as part of the full investigative process before any action is taken against an individual.

## Use Case ID: DHS-204

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** ICE

**Use Case Name:** Semantic Search and Summarization for Investigative Reports

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-204
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: ICE
- Purpose Statement: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is a critical component of ICE, responsible for investigating crimes that threaten national security, public safety, and the economy. HSI’s mission is to protect the United States from transnational crime and terrorism by disrupting organizations involved in human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, cybercrime, and other illicit activities. HSI relies on advanced technologies to analyze and process vast amounts of data, including audio and video evidence. Effective investigations depend on the ability to extract relevant information quickly and accurately from large volumes of unstructured reports. Traditional lexical search methods often fall short in this regard. Semantic Search and Summarization technology bridges this gap by leveraging large language models (LLM) to allow investigators to submit natural language queries.  These queries are analyzed to identify the most relevant information in reports, accelerating investigative analysis by rapidly identifying persons of interest, surfacing trends, and detecting networks or fraud. Furthermore, the system allows investigators to build reports by entering raw notes and leveraging LLM to generate a draft report that adheres to the Report of Investigation (ROI) manual's formatting and style guidelines. This saves time and produces more articulate and accurate reports. Once reviewed, validated, and approved by supervisors, the final report is uploaded to a case management system. HSI uses this tool to generate leads, with further action required by investigators and analysts as part of the full investigative process before any action is taken against an individual.
- Benefit Statement: Effective investigations require querying large volumes of unstructured reports to extract and summarize contextually-relevant information. Current lexical search methods are insufficient for finding such information. Semantic Search and Summarization enables contextually-relevant information extraction and summarization from large volumes of unstructured investigative reports. The output will enhance and optimize investigative analysis by accelerating person-of-interest identification, surfacing trends, and improving network or fraud detection.

## Use Case ID: DHS-2402

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** ICE

**Use Case Name:** SEVP Response Center Chatbot - SID (SEVIS Interactive Dialog)

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-2402
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: ICE
- Purpose Statement: The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) has a response center that answers questions about policy, procedures, and issues with Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). To provide faster answers, SEVP uses a chatbot named SEVIS Interactive Dialog (SID) to handle common questions from students and officials. If SID cannot help, it connects the caller to a human agent and shares the conversation to save time. Callers include visa holders (F, M, and J nonimmigrants), school and program officials, government users, and members of the public. Many questions are routine inquiries about established policies and procedures. SID is a conversational chatbot that uses voice recognition and Natural Language Understanding to understand and reply to users’ questions with scripted answers. SID is deterministic and does not use generative AI. It answers frequently asked questions but SEVP will not be programmed SID to answer safety- and/or rights-impacting questions. If SID cannot answer a question, it transfers the caller to an agent in the response center. The chatbot captures the interaction with the caller and sends the information via an API to Student and Exchange Visitor Program Automated Management System (SEVPAMS). SEVPAMS creates a tickets, either for calls completed by SID or those handed over to an agent. This allows agents to see the dialog between SID and the caller, reducing the need to repeat information. This frees up the human agents to handle  more complex cases and specific record issues.
- Benefit Statement: AI provides SID the ability to understand voices and its deterministic question and answer workflow (1) enables SID to answer routine caller questions without a help desk agent, and (2) when a help desk agent is required, SID will create a ticket with a caller transcript to reduce the burden on the agent. This frees up the human agents to deal with more complex cases and issues with specific records.

- Bureau / Department: ICE
- Purpose Statement: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is a critical component of ICE, responsible for investigating a wide range of crimes that threaten national security, public safety, and the economy. With a mission to protect the United States from transnational crime and terrorism, HSI works to disrupt and dismantle complex organizations that engage in human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, cybercrime, and other illicit activities. During an investigation, HSI collects large volumes of legally obtained evidentiary data, often in languages other than English. Once this data has been translated using translation and transcription services, agents and analysts need a better way to search through the vast amounts of data. The Title III Semantic Search and Summarization functionality will augment translation and transcription services by extracting relevant data using machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for correlation and semantic search. Results can then be summarized using a Large Language Model (LLM), giving users a tool to target relevant data only. This capability accelerates investigative analysis by rapidly identifying persons of interest, surfacing trends, and detecting networks or fraud, saving hundreds of hours in manual analysis. HSI will use this tool to generate leads, and further action will be required by investigators and analysts as part of the full investigative process before any action is taken against an individual.

**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-2420
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: OHS
- Purpose Statement: The goal for this proof-of-concept project is to create wholistic visuals of a wide variety of health security data. These data will be pulled from online open sources to broadly include, for example, news on societal conflicts, scientific literature, and reports on weather and aggregated (not individual level) information on disease for humans and wildlife. Visuals will be created using two different approaches. One approach (MedINT Dashboard) is to view global mapping of the health security events, where each event is tagged on the map to its reported location. The map can be modified to view different health security layers and zoomed in/out to locations of interest. The second approach (MedINT Canvas) is to build a data visualization of interest by selecting topics, such as a disease, symptom, and location, and then observing if and how these topics connect through recent health security events. AI/ML will make this project possible by streamlining the pull of openly available online data into a machine-readable dataset. AI/ML will also support the MedINT Canvas visuals by finding relevant terms in online articles, labeling articles accordingly, and ranking them for relevance to topics of interest. These necessary steps cannot practically be performed by people. Allowing analysts to wholistically visualize health security data will enable identification of potential threats that should be further investigated. 

The main AI system output will be the translation of online information into a structured, machine-readable dataset. This includes language translation for non-English articles, labeling articles by health threat types, and ranking articles by relevance to health threats. This dataset will then be used to create the wholistic visuals in Canvas and Dashboard. 

MedINT will use only open-source and aggregated level data without personal identifiers.  It will not use individual medical data.

## Use Case ID: DHS-2421

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** OHS

**Use Case Name:** One Health Threat Detection and Risk Assessment Platform (OH-TREADS) / Planner

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-2421
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: OHS
- Purpose Statement: The goal for this proof-of-concept project is to create wholistic visuals for health surveillance from relevant data and information sourced (open and non-public) from  International, Federal, State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (IFSLTT) partners and stakeholders in interdependent sectors, including but not limited to the Food & Agriculture and Healthcare & Public Health sectors. By combining human, animal, plant, and environmental data, with critical infrastructure data, we aim to generate an integrated One Health data landscape that can aid decision making, early warning, and enhanced situational awareness. This would improve detection, prevention, and mitigation of emerging threats to health, food, and agriculture  (such as Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), climate, pests/vectors, invasive species, etc.) whether natural, intentional, or accidental, and promote health security, preparedness, and resilience across domains, disciplines, sectors, and stakeholders. OHTREADs will use a similar approach to Medical Intelligence (MedINT), employing a dashboard to present a telescoping global-to-local map that will highlight health incidents, cases, or other epidemiological relevant data that can be linked via geospatial or temporal factors. Upon clicking the map, the user will be able to achieve state or county level data visualization, or other relevant user-filtered information for active incidents involving pathogens/agents of interest, including risk and predictive transmission values. AI/ML makes this project possible by streamlining the pull of accessible data into machine-readable datasets from veterinary syndromic, clinical, diagnostic, or other surveillance data sets. AI/ML will also create the OH-TREADs/Planner visuals and allow for analytical interpretation. 

The volume of data, and lack of clear data collection standards, requires AI/ML to help merge streams with different data ontologies while facilitating data interoperability with mis-paired data sets. AI/ML will also be used to generate risk and predictive scores, displaying relevant information and analyses that help analysts understand health security threats and broadly monitor the health security landscape. This comprehensive situational awareness will support data-driven decision making to prevent, mitigate, and respond to health threats. 

The main AI system outputs will be anomaly detection following the translation of information into a structured, machine-readable datasets. AI/ML is then used for risk identification and disease prediction, which are overlayed on a map and displayed with other wholistic visuals. These visuals and analytics can be combined with critical infrastructure locations, resources, or capabilities (federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial) to aid response and decision making. 

OH-THREADS will use a combination of open source and public health data sets as well as animal health records.  It will not use individual medical data. 
- Benefit Statement: Visuals will be created using a broad variety of data pulled from open-source, public, and non-public sources. AI/ML will make it possible to ingest data from a variety of digital formats, and translate it to usuable information into machine-readable data. The volume of data, and lack of clear data collection standards, requires AI to help merge streams with different data ontologies while facilitating data interoperability with mis-paired data sets. Neither activity is, or can be, practically performed by people. AI/ML will be further used in Planner to generate risk and predictive scores in addtion to displaying relevant information and analyses that help analysts understand health security threats and broadly monitor the health security landscape. AI/ML is meant to provide comprehensive situational awareness for health surveillance and public health response, with target capabilities that: enable global situational awareness of current and potential health risks from a One Health perspective; assist in early warning of health threats by location, facility, and species; aid in rapid identification of health threats at population, facility, and greater geographic resolution; and support data-driven decision making to prevent, mitigate, and respond to health threats.

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-132
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: TSA
- Purpose Statement: This AI helps airplane luggage checks by the TSA officers scanning bags to have a continuous always watching partner to alert them to anything suspicious. Accessible Property Screening (APS) uses AI to identify both non-explosive threats and prohibited items in carry-on baggage as the bags pass through the Computed Tomography (CT) scanners at airports. The AI algorithms are trained to identify likely non-explosive threat and prohibited items through image segmentation and object recognition.  

Currently, Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) assigned to scanners at airport checkpoints visually inspect each image.  The TSOs resolve the system generated explosive alarms as well as visually inspect the image for the presence of non-explosive prohibited items such as guns and sharp objects. TSA is working on developing new AI and Machine Learning ML algorithms to automate the search for the non-explosive prohibited items (e.g. guns, knives, etc.). These AI solutions benefit the public by providing a consistent and uninterrupted level of threat detection as an added layer of security. The ML algorithms allow the TSOs to be more flexible and to better prioritize their attention on important items to improve security. 

AI system output is a set of 3-dimentional bounding boxes that is displayed on the X-ray image. The bounding boxes are placed on top of objects or areas where the algorithm believes it has found a prohibited item (threat object).
- Benefit Statement: This AI helps airplane luggage checks by the TSA officers scanning bags to have a continuous always watching partner to alert them to anything suspicious. 

Currently, a Transportation Security Officer (TSO) who is assigned to every X-ray equipment at an airport checkpoint visually inspects each image. This officer resolves the system generated explosive alarms as well as visually inspecting the image for the presence of non-explosive prohibited items such as guns and sharp objects (see TSA Travel site).
TSA is working on developing new Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms to automate the search for the non-explosive prohibited items (e.g. guns, knives, etc.).  Once a threat is found, the algorithm displays bounding boxes around the suspect item for the operator to then investigate and adjudicate.  
These AI solutions benefit the public by providing a consistent and uninterrupted level of threat detection as an added layer of security. The ML algorithms allow the TSA officers to be more flexible and to better prioritize their attention on important items to improve security.

## Use Case ID: DHS-133

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** TSA

**Use Case Name:** Walk-Through Metal Detector (WTMD) Alternative Automated Target Recognition (ATR) Developments

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-133
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: TSA
- Purpose Statement: AI-enhanced Millimeter wave (mmWave) detectors are used as an alternative to Walk-Through Metal Detectors (WTMDs) for passenger screening to detect both metallic and non-metallic threats and prohibited items on passengers at the security checkpoint. These detectors are an improvement over traditional walk-through metal detectors and provide increased security and a better passenger experience. mmWave body scanners use safer, skin-sensitive, non-ionizing radiation to find concealed objects using pre-defined rule-based and deep learning algorithms to identify prohibited items and relay that information to the Transportation Safety Officers (TSOs) on duty at the checkpoint.

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-178
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCG
- Purpose Statement: This AI system helps the USCG assign a numerical risk score for Small Passenger Vessels (SPV) relative to one another. The SPV Safety Task Force leveraged machine learning (ML) and subject matter expert (SME) input to create an adaptable, quantitative analysis tool that reliably identifies the key drivers of marine casualties and calculates a risk score for each vessel within the largest segment of the U.S.-inspected fleet. A vessel risk score is computed with an analytic model that leverages logistic regression and basic ML. The risk score is then combined with an SME-derived consequence score that considers the number of vessel passengers and operation distance from shore. The final combined number is used to categorize a vessel into one of three tiers: at the lowest risk tier, vessels will receive, at a minimum, mandated inspections as per Title 46 Code of Federal Regulations, while vessels in tiers 2 and 1 may receive more frequent or more thorough inspections by more experienced inspectors. Before an inspection recommendation is communicated to the vessel owner, an SME reviews and approves the vessel scores. Follow-on policy efforts set the required scope and frequency of inspection, the minimum competency of the lead inspector, and the level of accountability for each vessel. In addition to their modeling and policy efforts, this team conducted extensive education and outreach with the field, district, and area commands to aid adoption and foster implementation. Their efforts directly improved marine inspector allocation, targeted risk, and enhanced the governance necessary to increase passenger safety across the country.

## Use Case ID: DHS-180

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** USCIS

**Use Case Name:** Automated Name and Date of Birth (DOB) Harvesting from Existing Records

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-180
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: Automated Name and Date of Birth (DOB) Harvesting is being developed to reduce the amount of adjudicative time spent manually harvesting aliases and DOBs from Identity History Responses (IdHS) text. The use case output draws from FBI Background Check System (BCS) source information and is provided to USCIS officers to consider during case processing. For aliases, this solution uses a named-entity recognition (NER) model trained to understand the specific context around where aliases appear—meaning it’s effective at locating true aliases, while at the same time avoiding other places where proper names may exist but are not aliases (e.g., county or street names). For DOBs, this solution uses pattern matching and conditional logic to harvest valid birth dates, while weeding out obvious placeholders and other non-birth dates found within the IdHS text.  This use case has been in production since 2022 and is enabled only for N400. The solution was developed as a Python library, and the encasing Flask application runs on Amazon EKS. Its primary function is to predict where aliases and dates of birth appear within unstructured IdHS text.  It uses a named-entity recognition (NER) model, trained using Spark NLP with a TensorFlow back end on thousands of systematically labeled IdHS records, and word-level embeddings. 

This use case reduces the amount of adjudicative time spent manually harvesting aliases and dates of birth (DOBs) from identity history summary (IdHS) report attached to the ELIS case as part of the Manual Name Harvesting Task during case processing. 

Eliminates need for manual review by extracting unique names and DOBs from IdHS documents and when names/DOBs are already in ELIS, ANH will not suggest any names. This is still a human in the loop process. The ELIS user performing MNH tasks is prompted to decide if the suggested names and DOBs are related to case hence can accept/reject the suggestions.

- **LOCATION**: Places mentioned within IdHS text, where specific address or location data could be relevant to USCIS processing (e.g., county or street names).
- **DATE**: None mentioned in this use case.
### **B. Dependency Parsing and Analysis**
Given the lack of detailed technical information, it is difficult to perform a full dependency parsing analysis. However, based on the text's grammatical structure, we can identify some key relationships:
- **Subject**: Purpose Statement and Benefit Statement both have "Automated Name and Date of Birth Harvesting" as their subject, which is the focus of the use case description.
- **Object**: The objects are usually the actions being performed on the subjects themselves (e.g., "used to reduce manual harvesting," and "developed for USCIS officers to consider during processing").
- **Key Sentence Structures**: The use case describes two main goals or constraints - first, reducing adjudicative time spent on manual harvesting; second, improving the accuracy of named entity recognition.
### **C. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**
Based on the provided text, we can identify the following functional requirements:
- **Data Processing:** Automated Name and Date of Birth Harvesting will be performing "data harvesting" from FBI Background Check System (BCS) source information to provide to USCIS officers for consideration.
- **Named Entity Recognition:** The system will use named-entity recognition (NER) model to identify aliases and DOBs from IdHS texts, which are specific types of named entities.
These functional requirements will satisfy the following non-functional requirements:
- **Performance:** The solution needs to be fast enough to handle large volumes of data in IdHS text, while also being accurate to avoid false positives and negatives.
- **Scalability:** The solution may need to process increasing amounts of data over time, as more cases are filed or processed using the system.
The following dependencies can be identified based on the provided information:

## Use Case ID: DHS-181

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** USCIS

**Use Case Name:** Automated Realtime Global Organization Specialist (ARGOS) for Company Registration Submissions to E-Verify

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-181
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: ARGOS searches publicly available datasets (like a human would) to establish risk and potential fraud associated with a company using E-Verify. The use case output informs USCIS Verification Account Compliance (VAC) analysts' decisions regarding whether a company applying to register on E-Verify is fraudulent and should be referred for investigation. ARGOS searches a multitude of public datasets for information that is then ranked and scored based on text analysis and a risk and fraud model developed in collaboration with the USCIS VAC team. The ARGOS application then displays that information to the end-user, allowing them to view the possibilities of fraud and make an informed decision. The goal of the use case is to streamline the process and accelerate work for the individual who is researching a company that has submitted its information for registration to E-Verify. 

ARGOS sentiment analysis produces a risk score, and keyword extraction identifies the keyword category of interest to the VAC management and program analysts (MPAs) for the aggregated open-source information. This helps quickly identify any pertinent information to aid the MPAs in their open-source investigation of company applications. This process saves potentially thousands of MPA man-hours in open-source investigation and creates a single source of truth for each MPA's investigation of a company application. In turn, this allows for quicker application processing and, if the risk of company fraud exists, much faster referral processing time, expediting the next-step referral to Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) for further investigations. 

Responses are sent back to a user dashboard accessible internally only by VAC Management and Program Analyst (MPA) personnel. Keywords related to the MPA's work interests are extracted if present, and risk scores are assigned to the open source collected information. The data is presented to the MPA on the graphical user interface (GUI) dashboard. 
- Benefit Statement: ARGOS sentiment analysis produces a risk score and keyword extraction identifies the keword category of interest to the VAC MPAs (management and program analyst) for the aggregated open-source information to help quickly identify any pertinent information to aid the MPAs in their open-source investigation of company applications.  This saves potentially thousands of MPA man hours in open-source investigation and creates a single source-of-truth for each MPAs investigation of a company application.  This, in turn, allows for quicker application processing and, if risk of company fraud exists, much faster referral processing time quickening the next-step referral to FDNS for further investigations.

## Use Case ID: DHS-14

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** USCIS

**Use Case Name:** Biometrics Enrollment Tool (BET) Fingerprint Maximization

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-14
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: The Biometric Enrollment Tool (BET) is custom-built biometric enrollment software for both domestic and overseas USCIS biometric collections. BET is integrated with the National Appointment Scheduling System (NASS) and the Customer Profile Management System (CPMS). This improves data integrity as BET utilizes data already collected in USCIS systems, reducing the amount of data entry by the Biometric Technician and the risk of typographic errors. BET assists in determining if the fingerprint taken is good enough quality to pass the FBI fingerprint check process. It provides immediate feedback when a set of prints is likely to be rejected by the FBI by incorporating machine learning (ML) models into the BET application. The FBI will not disclose their quality grading criteria for fingerprints, leaving BET with the responsibility of determining quality to prevent unnecessary secondary encounters with applicants. Using even the simplest of models would catch 98% of rejected submissions, which could have potentially saved USCIS from scheduling 42,763 additional appointments in 2020. This would come at the cost of forcing recapture during 11% of encounters. This effort aims to maximize the number of successful FBI submissions while minimizing the number of fingerprint recaptures necessary. The output is a Numerical Fingerprint Quality score, which is compared against fingerprint quality thresholds (per finger and per set of fingerprints) to align with FBI specifications.

- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: USCIS created the Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) Directorate to strengthen the integrity of the nation’s immigration system and to ensure that immigration benefits are not granted to individuals who may pose a threat to national security and/or public safety. In addition, the FDNS Directorate is responsible for detecting, deterring, and combating immigration benefit fraud.  In 2005, USCIS developed a case management system, the Fraud Detection and National Security-Data System (FDNS-DS), to record, track, and manage the screening processes related to immigration applications, petitions, or requests with suspected or confirmed fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, and to identify vulnerabilities that may compromise the integrity of the legal immigration system.  In June 2023, FDNS-DS was replaced with a modernized case management system, FDNS-DS NexGen.  In the future, FDNS-DS NexGen may use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) data from other applications to aid in investigative work, enhance investigative case prioritization, and detect duplicate case work. USCIS may also integrate AI/ML into the predictive modeling for future system enhancements, working side-by-side with the business stakeholders to develop best practices. Fraud occurs in numerous ways; being able to discover and detect persons with multiple identities allows for more comprehensive investigations, reduces investigative cycle time, and improves performance. Future implementation of AI/ML techniques will speed up case and investigative processing by several magnitudes. For more information, please visit: https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhsuscispia-013-01-fraud-detection-and-national-security-directorate  While FDNS-DS NexGen is in production, the AI/ML functionality is still in discovery stages.

## Use Case ID: DHS-189

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** USCIS

**Use Case Name:** ELIS Card Photo Validation via myUSCIS

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-189
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: USCIS uses a system called ELIS to manage immigration requests, and it includes a Photo Validation Service to check if ID photos meet requirements. This helps ensure photos are correct before making ID cards, saving time and avoiding delays. USCIS is the component within DHS that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. USCIS receives immigration requests from individuals seeking immigration and non-immigration benefits. Once a benefit request form is submitted to USCIS, a series of processing and adjudication actions occur. One of the case management systems used to track and adjudicate certain immigration request forms is the Electronic Information System (ELIS). USCIS ELIS is an internal case management system composed of microservices to assist with performing complex adjudicative and processing tasks; one of those microservices is the Photo Validation Service. The card photo validation solution was originally designed for e-filed I-765 (c)(3)s — to be in direct support of the beneficiary as they apply via myUSCIS. In enabling e-filing for the (c)(3)s, one goal was to have everything captured digitally, including these ID photos, all while avoiding any new delays or complications for the applicant in the process. In other words, if we observed an issue with a photo upon upload, we wanted to address it up front — rather than waiting until a failed card production sequence.  Because the photo requirements themselves are fixed, this exact same functionality could also be plugged directly into ELIS, just prior to card production. As of late October 2021, an effort to do exactly this is underway. The primary difference is that an adjudicator would explicitly request that a case’s photo be validated, and if applicable, the service would return a recommendation to edit the photo before submission. 

The photo validation service uses a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning models to validate photographs and ensure they meet the requirements, so these photographs can be used in card production. The output is Response back to user based on the pre-defined quality checks if the uploaded photo meets USCIS requirements. Users still have the option to ignore the warnings and upload the photo. 
- Benefit Statement: USCIS uses a system called ELIS to manage immigration requests, and it includes a Photo Validation Service to check if ID photos meet requirements. This helps ensure photos are correct before making ID cards, saving time and avoiding delays.

### **B. Dependency Parsing and Analysis**
A dependency parsing analysis is not applicable in this context. However, based on the use case, it can be inferred that the system output will depend on the quality of input photo submitted by the user. If the photos are validated as meeting requirements, users can proceed with using them for card production, and if they do not meet requirements, users may choose to edit them.
### **C. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**
**Functional Requirements:**
- The system must validate the ID photos submitted by the user against predetermined requirements and return recommendation to edit prior to submitting. If photos meet requirements, users can proceed with using them for card production.
- Processing and adjudicating applications related to immigration benefits from ELIS system.
**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Scalability: The system must be capable of handling a high volume of photo validation requests without compromising the quality or accuracy of its outputs.
- Performance: The system must validate photos quickly and accurately, while minimizing any delays in the card production process.
### **D. Value Categorization**
Based on this categorization, ELIS Photo Validation Service would fall under the classification of "Breakthrough Enabler". This is because it redefines the traditional ways of validating IDs by using computer vision techniques and machine learning models to achieve a novel outcome: ensuring that ID photos meet requirements before they are used for card production. The value lies in avoiding delays and complications that may arise from submitting invalid photos, saving time and resources while ultimately improving the quality of immigration benefits processing.
### **E. Operational Impact and Transformation**
**Operational Impact:**
- Improved efficiency by enabling the validation of ID photos up front within the ELIS system, thereby reducing delays in the production process.
- Reduced cost by avoiding the need for additional photo retakes due to rejections resulting from inconsistencies with USCIS requirements.
- Improved security through ensuring that the IDs produced are accurate and legitimate.
**Transformation:**
The Photo Validation Service transforms the traditional way of validating ID photos by automating the process using computer vision techniques and machine learning models. This transformation enables greater accuracy, efficiency, and security in the production of immigration benefits such as cards. 
### **F. Value Metrics**
1. Operational metrics: The system's ability to process a high volume of photo validation requests quickly and accurately can be assessed using metrics such as response time or error rates. These metrics provide insight into the efficiency and accuracy of the system, thus informing operational decision-making.

2. Organizational benefits: The Photo Validation Service reduces costs by avoiding additional retake fees resulting from rejected photos due to inconsistencies with USCIS requirements. It also improves the quality of immigration benefits processing, which may lead to increased customer satisfaction and improved reputation for DHS's USCIS program.

## Use Case ID: DHS-16

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** USCIS

**Use Case Name:** ELIS Evidence Classifier Machine Learning (ML) Tagging Solution

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-16
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: The Evidence Classifier Service is a machine learning (ML) solution that reduces the time spent by adjudicators and contractors sifting through digital evidence. The solution systematically tags and surfaces critical evidence types for the adjudicators in Electronic Immigration System (ELIS). Until the Evidence Classifier ML solution's introduction, those working on cases and responsible for reviewing evidence documents would often have to sift through dozens, if not hundreds, of unlabeled pages to find one specific artifact. As a result, an ML solution was built to systematically tag individual pages with some of the highest-volume, highest-impact evidence types. 

The service enables end users to navigate directly to the page(s) containing evidence documents of interest, instead of sifting through large PDF documents. Evidence tagging intends to accelerate case processing by identifying specific types of documents (e.g., I-589, passport photo spread, marriage certificate) and applying a metadata tag to that document object in ELIS. When a user opens a case with potentially hundreds of pages of evidence documents they have clickable bookmarks from these tags that will jump directly to the corresponding page. 

The output is tagged evidence. The system inputs an image (scanned document from Lockbox) and outputs either a specific label, such as "Border Crossing Card - Front," or no label if that document is not recognized as one of the classes. 
- Benefit Statement: To enable end users to navigate directly to the page(s) containing evidence documents of interest instead of sifting through large PDF documents. Evidence tagging intends to accelerate case processing by identifying specific types of documents (e.g., I-589, passport photo spread, marriage certificate) and applying a metadata tag to that document object in ELIS. This way, when a user opens a case with potentially hundreds of pages of evidence documents, rather than scrolling through them one at a time to find a specific document of interest, they have clickable "bookmarks" in the UI generated from these tags that will jump directly to the corresponding page.

**Bureau / Department:** USCIS

**Use Case Name:** I-485 Family Matching

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-61
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: I-485 Family Matching is designed to create models to match family members to underlying I-485 petitions. The underlying immigrant petition defines if the I-485 is employment-based or family-based. It also has information about the visa classification and priority date which, when compared against the Department of State’s monthly Visa Bulletin, helps predict visa usage. It is difficult to match an I-485 to its underlying immigrant petition, because the only available field on which to match is the Alien-number (A-number). This number is not always present on the immigrant petition, and name/date of birth matching is not as reliable.  The goal of I-485 Family Matching is to leverage AI to create connections more confidently between petitioners and their families based on limited data.  Additionally, it was intended to help identify and group I485s filed by family members, as well as gather up the many ancillary forms they may have been pending (such as I765, I131). Similar to immigrant petition matching, it can be difficult to match up I485s filed by family members. In these cases, the only similar fields are a common address. Efforts have been made in the past to identify family members by address, but it is effective only to a point. This use case explored the technical feasibility of using an AI model to help make working with this data more reliable (as well as group individual petitioners, their families, and other helpful associated data together for faster and more accurate processing).  Work on this use case did not go beyond ideation and no AI model was built (and no output was rendered) after the proof-of-concept established that the desired end-state was infeasible with the technology available at that time.

## Use Case ID: DHS-414

**Agency:** DHS

**Bureau / Department:** USCIS

**Use Case Name:** I-765 - USCIS Face Capture Mobile App

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-414
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: Utilizing facial capture in the mobile application reduces the burden on both Application Support Centers and customers by providing an alternative method for capturing card-quality photographs used for document production. Application Support Center appointments are limited to work hours, often requiring applicants to take time off work. In some regions, applicants may need to travel long distances to reach an application support center and inclement weather can make attending appointments difficult. The mobile application enables photograph collection without the need for a biometrics appointment, enhancing processing efficiency for adjudicators and offering greater convenience for applicants. This will allow the user to complete the biometric verification requirement without having to attend an appointment at an Applicant Support Center. This reduces the burden on the beneficiary and decreases demands on USCIS Applicant Support Center resources. 

Face detection locates human faces in visual media such as digital images or video. When a face is detected, it has an associated position, size, and orientation; it can also be searched for landmarks such as the eyes and nose, which are returned as numerical values.

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-413
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: USCIS intends to leverage facial recognition for several reasons. Multiple court orders require the adjudication of employment authorization applications within 30 days. Currently, applicants must attend an Application Support Center to verify their identity and capture a photograph, which can take up to three weeks of the 30-day period. Using the facial verification service makes this process nearly instant and greatly enhances processing efficiency without compromising the effectiveness of current identity verification methods. Additionally, new rules created by the FBI’s Compact Council require biometric verification to perform fingerprint resubmissions for different filing reasons than the original fingerprint capture. Facial verification brings USCIS into compliance with this rule change. Furthermore, performing facial verification increases the integrity of information and identities by identifying conflicts early on, preventing issues from becoming pervasive across immigration systems. This will allow the user to complete the biometric verification requirement without having to attend an appointment at an Applicant Support Center. This reduces the burden on the beneficiary as well as reducing demands on USCIS Applicant Support Center resources. The output is a match or no match response from IDENT.

- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: USCIS uses the Identity Match Option (IMO) tool to aid in person-centric research and analytics. More specifically, IMO is used to derive a single identity across multiple systems for each applicant or beneficiary who interacts with USCIS. USCIS maintains a variety of systems to track specific interactions with individuals – benefits case management, appointment scheduling, background check validation, and customer service inquiries. Each system captures its own person-centric data attributes (e.g., Social Security Number (SSN), Alien number (A-number), name, date of birth (DOB), address, etc.) related to individuals interacting with the agency. The system is designed to handle different data formats and potential data quality issues present in the source data to identify duplicate identities in a data set or between two data sets. The derived identities are linked back to the original source records, enabling USCIS personnel to view an individual's comprehensive interaction history with the agency.  The output of this can be visualized through a report or dashboard to assist with case review, ensuring access to helpful and accurate records. 

A user-friendly dashboard is created to display results and shows the data pattern but does not allow for any prediction or decision making. IMO is a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) product offered by Informatica. The product has a variety of “transformations” that can be used together to build a workflow-based solution. There are several different algorithms (Soundex, Jaro, Hamming distance, etc.) which are available for use in performing identity resolution.

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-55
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: The vision of Person-Centric Identity Services (PCIS) is to be the authoritative source of trusted biographical and biometric information that provides real-time, two-way visibility between services into an individual's comprehensive immigration history and status. The de-duplication model ingests person-centric datasets from various source systems for model training and evaluation purposes. Our dataset includes biographic information (e.g., name, date of birth, alien number Social Security Number, passport number) as well as biographic information (e.g., fingerprint IDs, eye color, hair color, height, weight) for model training and matching purposes. Critical to the success of PCIS is the entity resolution and de-deduplication of individual records from various systems of records to create a complete picture of a person. Using machine learning (ML), the model can identify which case management records belong to the same unique individual with a high degree of confidence. This allows PCIS to compile a full immigration history for an individual without the need for time-consuming research across multiple disparate systems. The de-duplication model plays a critical role in the entity resolution and surfacing of a person and all their associated records. The ML models are more resilient to fuzzy matches and handle varying data fill rates more reliably. 

Using Machine Learning allows us to improve entity resolution as compared to rule-based system. PCIS offers the ability to see a person's immigration history organized in one place. Specific benefits do or will include: an organized summary view of the identity with the individual's latest photo from PCIS; full immigration history including receipts associated with the applicant, regardless of case management system; mailing, physical, and safe history of the individual organized in reverse chronological order, allowing users to easily find the most recent address; all identifiers associated with the applicant, including Alien number, Social Security Number, passport number, etc.; and a numerical likelihood score which is used to determine if the record belongs to the individual, subjected to a high threshold (.98, maximum 1) to assess whether the record belongs to the individual.

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-2386
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: The Sentiment Analysis - FOD Field Offices Complaints and Reviews system analyzes feedback received by USCIS to determine the positive or negative sentiments expressed. This system provides a statistical analysis of quantitative results from complaints, reviews the results, and then uses machine learning (ML) techniques to assign sentiments to categories ranging from strongly positive to strongly negative. This helps survey administrators to identify trends and glean valuable from both quantitative and qualitative data. This capability is currently available and under consideration by the Field Operations Directorate (FOD). FOD receives complaints from the public through the USCIS Office of Investigations (OI) via telephone, mail, email, and a dedicated website. These complaints contain detailed descriptions of the in-office experiences. FOD personnel read, research, and resolve these complaints on a case-by-case basis. FOD uses the Sentiment Analysis - FOD Field Offices Complaints and Reviews system for ML analysis to provide an extra layer of information that helps FOD identify and resolve issues generally (without changing the process of resolving complaints). Currently, FOD reports complaints counts by pending and resolved and general bins determined by FOD HQ. It’s this binning that FOD would like to improve because they may be missing key trends and/or early identification of general issues. FOD were looking for generalization, a summary of aggregated complaints. 

The system categorizes feedback sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral tones, displayed in a dashboard. This graphical representation helps visualize how customer service can be improved but does not provide specific recommendations or decisions. 
- Benefit Statement: This system indicates the positive or negative feelings people express in their feedback to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

This indicates that the organization may have multiple departments or offices responsible for collecting feedback. Additionally, FOD, which is the Field Operations Directorate within USCIS, is considering implementing this sentiment analysis system to gain insights from both quantitative and qualitative data. Therefore, organizations such as FOD and USCIS may be important entities in this use case.
- **LOCATION**: The purpose statement mentions that complaints are received by USCIS through various channels such as telephones, mail, email, and a dedicated website. While these channels do not provide specific information about the location of complainants or where they submitted their feedback from, it is possible that the system may need to identify spatial patterns in the complaints data to understand trends across different geographical regions.
- **DATE**: The purpose statement mentions that FOD receives complaints from the public through the USCIS Office of Investigations (OI) via telephone, mail, email, and a dedicated website, indicating that the system may need to analyze feedback received on different dates. Additionally, the Benefit Statement provides specific dates for when this system was implemented. Therefore, the analysis of sentiments in complaints data would likely involve comparing trends across different time periods.
B. Dependency Parsing and Analysis: 
- There are no direct mentions of grammatical relationships or dependency labels in this use case. However, it is possible that the sentiment analysis system may need to identify subject-verb-object patterns or other linguistic structures in the feedback data to accurately categorize sentiments.
- The purpose statement indicates that FOD receives complaints through multiple channels and then uses machine learning (ML) techniques to assign sentiments to categories ranging from strongly positive to strongly negative. This suggests that there may be some ambiguity or incomplete dependencies between the different sources of feedback and how they are analyzed for sentiment categorization.
- There may also be constraints regarding the performance of the system, given that it is being used to analyze large volumes of complaints data. Therefore, identifying and mitigating any potential bottlenecks in the processing and analysis of such data would likely be important for ensuring the overall effectiveness of the sentiment analysis system.
C. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Functional Requirements: The system must be able to receive complaints through various channels, analyze them using machine learning techniques, and categorize sentiments into one or more categories ranging from strongly positive to strongly negative. Additionally, the system must provide a graphical representation of feedback sentiments in the form of a dashboard that displays general trends but does not make specific recommendations or decisions for how to improve customer service.
- Non-Functional Requirements: The sentiment analysis system must be user-friendly and easy to use, allowing FOD personnel to quickly analyze and understand sentiments in the feedback data. Additionally, the system must be scalable enough to handle large volumes of complaints data while maintaining performance levels that meet required timelines for reviewing and resolving complaints. Finally, the system must adhere to industry best practices regarding security and privacy, ensuring that sensitive information related to customer feedback is kept secure at all times.
D. Value Categorization: 
- Efficiency Amplifier: The sentiment analysis system may be considered an Efficiency Amplifier as it allows FOD personnel to quickly analyze sentiments in large volumes of complaints data, which would likely be more time-consuming and challenging to do manually. By providing a graphical representation of feedback sentiments, the system also allows for faster decision-making about how to address any potential customer service issues.
- Organizational Benefits: The implementation of this sentiment analysis system may lead to organizational benefits in terms of increased efficiency and productivity of FOD personnel who are responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints. Additionally, the ability to identify trends in feedback that is potentially negative could help prevent reputational damage or other negative outcomes for USCIS overall.
- Societal Impact: Given that the sentiment analysis system is being used in a government agency responsible for immigration services, it may have broader societal impacts by ensuring that customer service issues are addressed in a timely and effective manner. Additionally, if the system were to be expanded or implemented in other parts of the government or private sector, it could potentially lead to improvements in overall customer service across various industries.
E. Value Metrics: 
- The value metrics for the sentiment analysis system may include measures such as the accuracy and completeness of sentiment categorization, the speed at which feedback is analyzed and sentiments are categorized, and the overall satisfaction levels of both FOD personnel as well as customers who submit feedback through different channels. Additionally, cost savings or other efficiency gains related to the use of automated tools for sentiment analysis may also be important value metrics for evaluating the overall effectiveness of this system.
F. Value Drivers: 
- The value drivers for the sentiment analysis system would likely include its ability to quickly and accurately categorize sentiments in large volumes of feedback data, which could potentially lead to faster decision-making and improved customer service outcomes. Additionally, any cost savings or efficiency gains related to the use of automated tools forsentiment analysis may also be important value drivers for this system. Finally, if the sentiment analysis system were able to demonstrate a positive impact on broader societal outcomes such as increasing public trust in government agencies or improving customer service in other industries, this would likely be another key driver of its overall perceived value.

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-231
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: USCIS is the component within DHS that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. That means USCIS receives, processes, and maintains all applications for admission for Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), or adjustments to LPR status. Also known as “green card” holders, LPRs are non-citizens who are lawfully authorized to live permanently within the United States and are required to fill out Form I-90, Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card (Green Card). Since there has been a considerable influx of green card applications, USCIS used a combination of exploratory data analysis to determine the most used categories for applicants submitting I-90's, and machine learning to create predictions of workloads. USCIS used the H20 machine learning model to allow USCIS analysts to build and run several machine learning models on big data in an enterprise environment and identify the model that performs the best. It has already been successful in identifying the most accurate model for the I-90 Form Timeseries Analysis and Forecasting use case.

**Use Case Name:** Verification Match Model

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-2384
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USCIS
- Purpose Statement: The Verification Match Model utilizes machine learning (ML) to gather information from multiple systems and match it to known records by comparing names, dates of birth, and other identifiers. This supports two key USCIS Verification Division (VER) programs: the Employment Verification Program (E-Verify) and the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program.  The model streamlines verification data integration services by providing a ranked order of the best matches, expressed as confidence scores, between the identifiers used by the two programs. These improved matches increase the accuracy of E-Verify and SAVE, ensuring they use the most recent and accurate documents to determine benefit status. E-Verify handles approximately 250,000 requests per day and SAVE handles approximately 70,000 requests per day. Multiple data verification models for SAVE and E-Verify exist, complicating efficiency and performance. By consolidating these into a single, unified Verification Match Model within a separate microservice, the use case aims to improve the accuracy of responses and reduce the need for manual review. ML plays a key role in the continuous improvement of these models, ultimately reducing the need for manual case reviews. 

Leveraging AI in the USCIS verification matching process of known records across systems is beneficial because it streamlines existing USCIS reviews by 1) improving system accuracy, 2) reducing human error through automated person-and-record match scoring, and 3) handling a higher volume of matches than traditional tools or manual processes can achieve.  The ouput is a recommendation and score indicating person-and-record match probability, used by verification systems (E-verify and SAVE) to improve accuracy in initial system responses. 
- Benefit Statement: Leveraging AI in the USCIS verification matching process of known records across systems is beneficial because it streamlines existing USCIS review by 1) improving associated system accuracy, 2) reducing human-error by automating person-and-record match scoring, and 3) matching at a higher volume than traditional tools or manual processes can capably achieve.

### Prompt


As a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:

<use_case>
**Details:**
- Use Case ID: DHS-415
- Agency: DHS
- Bureau / Department: USSS
- Purpose Statement: The investigative mission of the USSS is to detect and arrest those that engage in crimes that undermine the integrity of U.S. financial and payment systems. During criminal investigations, USSS Office of Investigations (INV) personnel may require the identification of potential victims of crimes (e.g., identity theft) or of individuals suspected of crimes. USSS INV personnel may submit available photographs or video stills of these unknown persons as probe images (facial images or templates searched against the gallery of a Facial Recognition Service [FRS]) to other government agencies for comparison against their image galleries.  

Additionally, USSS INV personnel may request another government agency to conduct a one-to-one comparison of two photographs or video stills for investigative use. 

INV will utilize the DHS Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM) repository to query images for investigation purposes. 

USSS INV personnel will query image galleries of known persons and may provide lists of potential matches. USSS INV personnel may use the potential matches to produce investigative leads that will assist in further identifying victims or suspects.
- Benefit Statement: The intended purpose of this AI is so that USSS INV personnel may submit available photographs or video stills of these unknown persons as probe images (facial images or templates searched against the gallery of an FRS) to other government agencies for comparison against their image galleries. The agencies will query their image galleries of known persons and may provide lists of potential matches. USSS INV personnel may use the potential matches to produce investigative leads which will assist in the further identification of victims or suspects. Additionally, USSS INV personnel may request another government agency to conduct a one-to-one comparison of two photographs or video stills  for investigative use.
