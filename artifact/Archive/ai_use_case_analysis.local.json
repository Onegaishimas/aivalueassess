The AI models encode past X-Ray images of vehicular border crossings in a semantically meaningful way and compare the current crossing to detect differences amongst the images to identify anomalies, which enables faster clearance at border crossings for safe and lawful vehicles operating through the U.S. land border ports of entry.\n02. **Operational Impact**: The use case has a potential operational impact by improving process efficiencies and expansions in capability. It aligns with traditional workflows but also introduces new operational paradigms, resulting in the identification of anomalies for faster and safer border crossings. The implementation context is not entirely clear from the use case documentation, but it can be inferred that there are several benefits to the efficiency improvements achieved through automated detection of anomalies compared to manual inspection.\n03. **Transformation Potential**: The use case has a moderate transformation potential by aligning with and departing from traditional workflows. It introduces new operational paradigms and technological boundaries, which could transform the way border crossings are managed. By automating anomaly detection, it reduces the likelihood of human error, improves accuracy and speed of identification, resulting in faster clearance rates for safe and lawful vehicles operating through U.S. land border ports of entry.\n04. **Risks and Mitigation Strategies**: The potential risks associated with the use case include biases or ethical concerns related to data privacy and security, as well as dependencies on technology for automated anomaly detection. Effective mitigation strategies could involve ensuring regulatory compliance, addressing any potential biases through training and/or algorithmic adjustments, and implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect the data collected during border crossings.\n05. **Indicators of Value Creation**: The key indicators of value creation include operational metrics, such as faster clearance rates and improved accuracy in anomaly detection. These outcomes result in benefits to both the government agency managing the border crossings (e.g., reduced risk of security breaches) and the individuals or companies operating vehicles through the ports (e.g., reduced wait times). The value drivers are explicitly stated in the purpose statement as \"enhancement of capability of humans to consistently detect items of interest/concern present\" and implicitly indicated in the benefits related to improved border crossing efficiency and safety.\n06. **Comparison to Similar Use Cases**: Through comparative analysis with other documented use cases, similarities and differences can be identified. For example, both this use case and \"Analyze X-ray Images for Airline Baggage Screening\" involve using AI models to analyze X-ray images for anomaly detection. However, the current use case focuses on border crossings while the other use case applies to airline baggage screening. Another comparison could be made with \"Anomaly Detection in Satellite Images,\" which involves identifying unusual patterns or activities in satellite imagery, but this use case is more focused on geospatial intelligence than on border security.\n07. **Recommendations for Improvement**: Based on the analysis above, several recommendations can be made to improve the clarity and effectiveness of the use case documentation. Firstly, a detailed implementation context should be provided to clarify the scope of the solution and its impacts. Secondly, the potential risks and mitigation strategies should be included in the risk assessment section to ensure transparency and effective management of security concerns. Finally, specific metrics or KPIs should be identified and tracked over time to enable continuous improvement and evaluation of the program's success."

This requires maintaining awareness of cross border conveyances such as automobiles, boats, and airplanes. Airship Outpost allows CBP to accurately identify conveyances (aircraft, vessels, automobiles) by ingesting images and then leveraging AI to identify the type of conveyance and to know where to read the alpha numeric values used to identify them (tail number, hull number, license plate). Standards and regulations for the external identification of various types of conveyances vary significantly. For instance, an aircraft tail number, a vessel hull number, and an automobile license plate number. Once a conveyance is identified, the system focuses on the appropriate location to capture the alphanumeric values used for identification.

User Story for CBP Officials:\nAs a CBP official responsible for border security, my goal is to ensure that all conveyances entering the country through Ports of Entry are properly identified and documented. The Airship Outpost AI system enables me to achieve this goal more efficiently by accurately identifying conveyances and capturing their identification numbers. This use case provides me with a valuable tool for monitoring cross-border activity and enforcing laws related to customs and immigration at the border. By reducing errors and improving accuracy, the Airship Outpost system helps prevent potential security risks that could arise from inaccurate or incomplete documentation.\nBenefit Statement: The use of AI technology for monitoring conveyances crossing the border can help the CBP more accurately identify and track cross-border activity, which is essential to maintaining national security and enforcing laws related to customs and immigration. By enabling faster and more accurate identification of conveyances, the Airship Outpost system can help streamline operations at the Ports of Entry and improve overall efficiency of border security efforts.\n**Risk Assessment:** \nThe use of AI in this operation has some potential risks associated with it. One of the main concerns is the possible introduction of biases into the system, which could result in unequal treatment of certain types of conveyances or individuals. Another risk is the possibility of operational dependencies on the AI technology, which could limit the agency's ability to respond effectively to unforeseen events or changes in policy.\n\nThe mitigation strategies for these risks include rigorous testing and validation of the AI algorithms to identify and address any issues related to fairness or accuracy. In addition, CBP should maintain a contingency plan that outlines alternative procedures in case of equipment malfunction or other disruptions in the AI system.\n**Comparison with Similar Use Case:** \nThe Airship Outpost use case shares some similarities with other uses of AI technology for law enforcement purposes, such as facial recognition software used by police departments to identify suspects. However, this use case differs from those in that it focuses specifically on cross-border activity and the identification of conveyances rather than individuals. Additionally, this use case has a broader scope than most law enforcement applications of AI because it involves multiple agencies (CBP and DHS) working together to monitor and document cross-border activity. \n**Actionable Recommendations:**\nTo enhance the effectiveness of the Airship Outpost use case, CBP officials should ensure that the system is properly validated and tested to identify any potential biases or errors in the AI algorithms. Additionally, they should work closely with other agencies involved in border security operations to ensure that all relevant data and information are shared between departments. Finally, CBP should be open to feedback from stakeholders who may have concerns about the use of AI technology for monitoring cross-border activity and work to address those concerns through transparent communication and engagement with local communities and other affected parties."

This transformation potential is likely to have significant benefits in terms of operational efficiencies and improved security at the DHS/CBP border.\n02. **Operational Impact**: As a CBP officer, I can expect increased processing speeds for high-volume parcels as the system employs computed tomography x-ray systems with automated recognition technology to detect contraband. Also, the use of AI-driven analytics in identifying anomalies improves my ability to conduct more accurate inspection tasks. This increase in efficiency can help reduce wait times and improve overall security operations at DHS/CBP borders.\n03. **Transformation Potential**: As a technology designer, I see this use case as having significant transformation potential due to its departure from traditional workflows of manual screening by CBP personnel. The automated recognition technology integrated into the computed tomography x-ray systems allows for faster and more accurate inspection capabilities, enabling better security operations at the DHS/CBP borders. This transformation may lead to significant cost savings for CBP and could potentially be applied in other areas of border security operations.\n04. **Risks and Mitigation Strategies**: As a risk assessment expert, I identify potential risks associated with the use case such as ethical concerns, biases, or operational dependencies. For example, if the AI algorithm used in identifying anomalies was found to have inherent biases against certain groups, it could potentially affect security operations and lead to human rights violations. To mitigate these risks, CBP personnel should receive regular training on detecting and avoiding such biased behaviors and the AI algorithm needs further validation ensuring fairness in its identifications.\n05. **Indicators of Value Creation**: As a business analyst, I identify key indicators of value creation, such as operational metrics, organizational benefits, or societal impacts. An explicit value driver could be the reduction in wait times at DHS/CBP borders due to increased processing speeds while an implicit value driver could be the potential for fewer security breaches by way of improved detection capabilities.\n06. **Comparison to Similar Use Cases**: As a senior border enforcement officer, I compare this use case with a similar one documented earlier. The previous use case dealt with identifying fraudulent documents at border crossings. While the primary objective in both cases was security enhancement, there were differences in outputs due to different technological approaches used. The dependency parsing showed that \"enhancing screening efficiency\" and \"identifying anomalies\" are the key drivers for value creation in this use case. However, in the previous use case, a larger number of features were identified, suggesting a more sophisticated system design.\n07. **Recommendations for Improvement**: As a security consultant, I provide recommendations to improve the clarity and strategic alignment of this use case. One recommendation is to clearly articulate the potential benefits that automated recognition technology can bring in terms of CBP personnel workload reduction and contraband detection accuracy enhancement. Additionally, further validation of the AI algorithm used in identifying anomalies should be conducted to ensure fairness in its identifications. Finally, operational metrics need to be defined clearly to measure the system's effectiveness in achieving its security goals at the DHS/CBP borders."

The purpose statement indicates that RAAS \"assists users\" in finding relevant documents and portions of document by specifying individual queries as natural language questions and responding with detailed, natural language answers. The system also facilitates attainment of related or more precise information through follow-up questions. This suggests that the use case enhances capability by providing a new way to discover information quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe output of the system includes summarization of content relevant to the questions and interests indicated by the conversation with the user, facilitating the attainment of related or more precise information through follow-up questions. This demonstrates that RAAS has the potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness for users of the Test and Evaluation document archive.\n\nOperational Impact: The use case has a high potential for improving process efficiencies by reducing the time required to search for relevant documents and providing accurate results consistently. It also expands capability by enabling users to ask questions in natural language, which is more intuitive and user-friendly than traditional keyword searches. RAAS could also introduce new operational paradigms by setting a standard for how information should be organized and made accessible within the agency.\n\nTransformation Potential: RAAS aligns with traditional workflows in that it facilitates the search for documents based on user queries, but it departs from traditional limits by enabling natural language queries instead of relying solely on keyword searches.

Leveraging this intelligent retrieval technology does not rely on extensive application changes and offers substantial benefits in providing round-the-clock support while prioritizing complex inquiries. This initiative aims to enhance survivor satisfaction and call center efficiency by reducing call handle times and maintaining or improving answer quality.  The current applications for handling agent inquiries for processing applications are resource-intensive, leading to high operational costs and inefficiencies, especially during peak periods immediately following presidential-declared disasters. Currently, FEMA has a repository on SharePoint called the Processing Procedures Manual (PPM) that houses more than 70 documents that make up over 2,000 pages worth of content and guidance. Agents search this content and guidance with find function and keyword search, first having to find the right document, and then using keyword-based search and find functionality, negatively impacting efficiency and quality and leading to increases in escalations to higher tiers of agents/support who are no longer freed up to work on more complex situations.  Implementation of a 24/7 digital, interactive application will expedite guidance comprehension and discovery to provide better support to disaster survivors during active disasters. The system would use AI and search capabilities to intelligently analyze FEMA policies and guidance and assist the agents through the assistance review and award process.  \n\nThe AI will enable agents to retrieve information quickly, reducing the overall time spent on each call.  By providing more accurate and relevant search results, the AI will help agents deliver consistent, correct responses.  Reducing the time spent per call will improve operational efficiency, leading to potential cost savings.  By empowering agents with the correct information, the tool will lower the frequency of escalations to supervisors, allowing them to focus on more complex cases.  The time saved through the AI tool will allow agents to handle more complex queries, ultimately improving service quality and survivor satisfaction.  As the AI tool is rolled out, it will provide a scalable solution that can grow with the agency\u2019s needs during large-scale disaster responses. \n- Benefit Statement: The AI addresses the inefficiency in the current manual search process, where agents spend significant time navigating static documents like PDFs (2000+ pages/70 documents) to answer survivor questions. As policies can change frequently, especially during disasters, it is crucial that agents access the most up-to-date information quickly and accurately.\n\nExpected Benefits and Positive Outcomes:\nFaster Response Times: The AI will enable agents to retrieve information quickly, reducing the overall time spent on each call.\nImproved Answer Accuracy: By providing more accurate and relevant search results, the AI will help agents deliver consistent, correct responses.\nCost Savings: Reducing the time spent per call will improve operational efficiency, leading to potential cost savings.\nReduced Escalations: By empowering agents with the correct information, the tool will lower the frequency of escalations to supervisors, allowing them to focus on more complex cases.\nIncreased Capacity for Complex Casework: The time saved through the AI tool will allow agents to handle more complex queries, ultimately improving service quality and survivor satisfaction.\nScalability: As the AI tool is rolled out, it will provide a scalable solution that can grow with the agency\u2019s needs during large-scale disaster responses.\n- System Outputs: Not provided\n</use_case>\n\nAddress the following key areas in your response:\nAA. **Named Entity Relationships**: Extract named entities in <use_case>.

These models include, but not limited to, predicting the number of households that will register for the Individuals and Households Program (IHP), the number of households that will require direct housing assistance, the number of temporary transitional housing units needed, the number of applicants for Public Assistance, the number of PA projects that applicants will submit, the number of sites that will need to be inspected per PA project, and the cost of delivering assistance.  Supervised learning models include sample statistics, generalized linear models, decision trees, and deep neural networks. \n\nThe purpose of these supervised learning models is for informational purposes, to produce predictions for to-be-determined quantities of interest and for decisional purposes that may include implicit use (e.g., seeing a large number of households requiring assistance may motivate FEMA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to consider requesting additional funding for the Disaster Relief Fund) or explicit use (e.g., the number of estimated housing units required may be used to determine the number of housing units to order just-in-time). Anticipated benefits of using supervised learning models include increased predictive performance, timely predictions, quantification of uncertainty, and rigor. \n\nThese supervised learning models produce predictions, not recommendations or decisions (though they can inform human users in making recommendations and decisions). At minimum, these models will produce point predictions for the different quantities of interest for disaster declarations. Additionally, they may produce prediction intervals or predictive distributions as feasible and appropriate for the given prediction problem. Often these outputs will be shared via business intelligence tools (e.g., Tableau or PowerBI) for wide internal FEMA use. Some predictions may be shared with a more restricted audience through simpler means (e.g., an excel workbook) as appropriate. \n- Benefit Statement: The purpose of these supervised learning models is two-fold:\n\n1.\tFor informational purposes: the models will produce predictions for to-be-determined quantities of interest. These quantities are often of interest to Agency personnel in the field, region, and headquarters, as well as DHS, OMB, NSC, and the Whitehouse.\n2.\tFor decisional purposes: in addition to being informative, the model\u2019s predictions are likely to be used for decision making.

This use case reports AI-enabled analysis on a one-time export of emails between ICE and Microsoft relevant to Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Emergency Directive 24-02. This use case does not perform live email analysis and only includes emails sent to/from ICE email accounts. \n\nThe Information Assurance Division (IAD) within ICE is responsible for providing Cybersecurity Services to ICE, including operating the ICE Security Operations and Computer Security Incident Response Center through its Cyber Defense & Intelligence Branch. The Branch performs information assurance mitigation, responds to (and reports on) Information Technology (IT) security incidents, performs systems vulnerability testing, and monitors and evaluates the security performance on sensitive enterprise systems. CISA published Emergency Directive (ED) 24-02: Mitigating the Significant Risk from Nation-State Compromise of Microsoft Corporate Email System in which all Federal Government Agencies were required to review the stored email metadata from Microsoft to determine if they were affected from the breach. This requires the investigation of tens of thousands of emails to determine if there were any signs of compromise or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage. \n\nThe use case was developed to assist ICE Security Operations Center (SOC) in reviewing a collection of emails between ICE personnel and Microsoft that were part of ED 24-02.\u202f It provides a faster mechanism for SOC analysts to determine indicators of compromise, reducing the level of effort for these individuals\u2019 analysis exponentially.\u202f To assist the analysts, Named Entity Recognition (NER) was used to detect PII and other associated keywords while a locally running Large Language Model (LLM), with no external connections, answers questions about selected emails.\u202f The LLM also answers preset questions formulated from Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The analysts use the outputs to expedite the detection of PII and key language within emails, reducing the time needed to analyze the total collection of emails.\u202f If the use case detects PII or key language, then those emails are ranked as higher risk and prioritized by the analyst. The analyst then inspects the email at that location for presence of the data and logs it manually allowing for specified actions based on the results of the analysts\u2019 review.\u202f Ultimately, all emails are manually inspected and depending on the circumstance of the investigation the ICE Privacy Office may be contacted notifying them of the PII that was exposed, or the analyst will provide the information to the SOC Leadership to initiate the incident response process to perform remediation actions needed.\u202f The use case only provides ranking for prioritized processing to the SOC analysts. \n- Benefit Statement: The use case was developed to assist ICE SOC in reviewing a collection of emails between ICE personnel and Microsoft that were part of ED 24-02.  The use case provides a faster mechanism to the SOC analysts to determine indicators of compromise, reducing the level of effort for these individuals\u2019 analysis exponentially.

Unlike facial identification or recognition, the facial verification function uses a one-to-one matching approach of the individual presenting to the Monitoring App during their check-in by comparing it against the ATD participant\u2019s photograph captured upon enrollment to determine whether the person is who they declare themselves to be. The Monitoring App can be launched from either an ICE ATD-issued mobile device or from the participant\u2019s personal mobile device.  It takes a series of photos of the participant during enrollment, which are stored in the ISAP ATD case management system. During subsequently checks in, an automatic 1:1 verification image of the individual in front of the phone\u2019s camera is matched against the stored profile images to enable the ICE ATD Case Manager to verify the participant\u2019s identity, using a proprietary algorithm. The technology also recognizes if a \u201clive\u201d person is in front of the camera, as opposed to a representation or image of a person. There is a visual ICE ATD Case Manager review if there is no match or if the matching attempt generates an error alert. The photos are only used for the described verification purpose and are not shared for any other purpose or with any other entity or database. Any pictures taken during the facial template capture are immediately deleted from the device and only the facial measurements are captured. \n\nThe ISAP Biometric Monitoring App is a technology option that allows participants to report in using a smartphone. This app verifies a participant\u2019s identity, determines their location, and quickly collects status change information. It adds functionality not available with telephonic methods and is less intrusive than a global positioning system unit. The ISAP Monitoring App limits in-person interactions for routine check-ins, allowing more time to be allocated to non-compliant participants, complex removal proceedings cases, and docket management. \n\nThere are two outputs related to using ISAP Biometric Monitoring App: either a participant passes the biometric match, or the photo is moved to a pending review status.   \n- Benefit Statement: ISAP Biometric Monitoring App is a technology option that allows participants to report in using a smartphone.

ATD consists of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), which utilizes case management and technology tools to support noncitizens compliance with release conditions, court hearings, and final orders of removal, while allowing them to remain in their communities as they move through the immigration process or prepare for departure from the United States. Once individuals are in the ATD-ISAP program, officers periodically perform case reviews to determine if current levels of case management and technology assignment are appropriate for the noncitizen in the program or if they need to be adjusted. During the case review, the officer will consider numerous factors to include, but not limited to, current immigration status, supervision and compliance history, pending benefits, being a care giver or care provider, current immigration stage, pending criminal history and/or convictions, the hurricane score, and other factors. The factor known as the Hurricane Score is a quasi-binomial, binary classification machine learning (ML) model that is given information by an analyst that is known about an individual (factors from case management details and participant actions) and determines the probability that the individual will abscond based on absconding patterns the model has learned from inactive ATD-ISAP case data. The model returns a score from 1-5, with the higher number equating to a higher risk. The officer may use this score as one of the many factors previously described when deciding the appropriate level of case management and technology for noncitizens enrolled in the ATD-ISAP program. Because the hurricane score can quickly evaluate an enormous amount of information on thousands of noncitizens in the ATD-ISAP program, it provides officers with additional insight that they would not have otherwise had when performing a case review. \n- Benefit Statement: The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) division would like to explore technology that could help lead to time savings and eliminate human error due to overburdened officers.  An AI generated hurricane score could also minimize the risk that a factor is overlooked due to officers being overburdened.  The hurricane score may be one factor that is used to inform the decision-making process. The \u201cHurricane Score\u201d models the potential risk (1-5) that a noncitizen who is released from detention with the requirement to check in with ICE through monitoring will abscond from the program, with a higher number indicating a higher risk of absconding.\n- System Outputs: Not provided\n</use_case>\n\nAddress the following key areas in your response:\nAA. **Named Entity Relationships**: Extract named entities in <use_case>.

This tool, intended for non-critical conversations, will supplement existing language services contracts by providing real-time capabilities during various touch points in the ICE process. ERO personnel, who regularly interact with individuals who speak little or no English, currently rely on professional interpretation and translation services, which can be slow to secure. The new machine learning (ML) solution aims to facilitate informal communication quickly and efficiently. When deployed, it will not be used alone for materials vital to an individual\u2019s rights or benefits, or when the source materials contain non-literal language, lack clear grammar, or are overly complex.  In such cases, ERO personnel must seek additional language assistance via bilingual staff or professional language lines. \n\nThe initiative, first spearheaded by the U.S. Coast Guard for maritime usage with support from the DHS Science and Technology Directorate through the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), received Fiscal Year 2022 funding for proof of concept. Solutions, in the form of mobile phone applications, are being developed under research and development phases and are projected to meet ERO\u2019s requirements by January 2026. The Machine Learning Translation Technology Initiative will offer real-time communication and translation services, providing voice-to-text, text-to-voice, and voice-to-voice translations in at least 21 languages. This technology will enhance the ability of ICE ERO personnel to provide meaningful access to programs and services for limited English proficient (LEP) noncitizens. \n- Benefit Statement: The solution will be used to facilitate non-critical communications only.

Mobile device analytics capabilities were developed to meet the growing need for investigators to quickly and effectively review and analyze the massive amounts of data extracted from mobile devices obtained in court-ordered seizures through a warrant or other investigative due process. The solution empowers investigators and analysts to identify and extract critical evidence, relationships, and networks from mobile device data, leveraging machine learning capabilities to determine locations of interest. Present capabilities are limited to the use of an algorithm for clustering of geo-location data, allowing investigators to identify `'stops'` and `'overlaps'` of locations from lawfully seized phones, where a `'stop'` is a location a phone may have remained for a period of time and an `'overlap'` is a location where multiple phones may have visited. By streamlining the analysis process, these capabilities aim to enhance the efficacy of HSI agents and analysts by providing advanced data processing to identify the most relevant information for lead generation in a shorter amount of time than manually processing, ultimately contributing to the disruption and dismantling of criminal networks and the protection of national security. HSI uses this tool to generate leads, and further action is required by investigators and analysts as part of the full investigative process before any action is taken against an individual.\n```\n| Relation | Dependent Word | Head Word |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|\n| nsubjpass (stops) | were remained | phone 1 and phone 2 |\n| amod (a period of time) | was remained | stops |\n| dobj (locations from lawfully seized phones) | extracted | critical evidence, relationships, and networks |\n| dobj (mobile device data) | clustered | geo-location data |\n\nCC.

HSI\u2019s mission is to protect the United States from transnational crime and terrorism by disrupting organizations involved in human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, cybercrime, and other illicit activities. HSI relies on advanced technologies to analyze and process vast amounts of data, including audio and video evidence. Effective investigations depend on the ability to extract relevant information quickly and accurately from large volumes of unstructured reports. Traditional lexical search methods often fall short in this regard. Semantic Search and Summarization technology bridges this gap by leveraging large language models (LLM) to allow investigators to submit natural language queries.  These queries are analyzed to identify the most relevant information in reports, accelerating investigative analysis by rapidly identifying persons of interest, surfacing trends, and detecting networks or fraud. Furthermore, the system allows investigators to build reports by entering raw notes and leveraging LLM to generate a draft report that adheres to the Report of Investigation (ROI) manual's formatting and style guidelines. This saves time and produces more articulate and accurate reports. Once reviewed, validated, and approved by supervisors, the final report is uploaded to a case management system. HSI uses this tool to generate leads, with further action required by investigators and analysts as part of the full investigative process before any action is taken against an individual.\n- Benefit Statement: Effective investigations require querying large volumes of unstructured reports to extract and summarize contextually-relevant information. Current lexical search methods are insufficient for finding such information. Semantic Search and Summarization enables contextually-relevant information extraction and summarization from large volumes of unstructured investigative reports.

To provide faster answers, SEVP uses a chatbot named SEVIS Interactive Dialog (SID) to handle common questions from students and officials. If SID cannot help, it connects the caller to a human agent and shares the conversation to save time. Callers include visa holders (F, M, and J nonimmigrants), school and program officials, government users, and members of the public. Many questions are routine inquiries about established policies and procedures. SID is a conversational chatbot that uses voice recognition and Natural Language Understanding to understand and reply to users\u2019 questions with scripted answers. SID is deterministic and does not use generative AI. It answers frequently asked questions but SEVP will not be programmed SID to answer safety- and/or rights-impacting questions. If SID cannot answer a question, it transfers the caller to an agent in the response center. The chatbot captures the interaction with the caller and sends the information via an API to Student and Exchange Visitor Program Automated Management System (SEVPAMS). SEVPAMS creates a tickets, either for calls completed by SID or those handed over to an agent. This allows agents to see the dialog between SID and the caller, reducing the need to repeat information. This frees up the human agents to handle  more complex cases and specific record issues.\n- Benefit Statement: AI provides SID the ability to understand voices and its deterministic question and answer workflow (1) enables SID to answer routine caller questions without a help desk agent, and (2) when a help desk agent is required, SID will create a ticket with a caller transcript to reduce the burden on the agent. This frees up the human agents to deal with more complex cases and issues with specific records.\n- System Outputs: Not provided\n</use_case>\n\nAddress the following key areas in your response:\nAA. **Named Entity Relationships**: Extract named entities in <use_case>.

These data will be pulled from online open sources to broadly include, for example, news on societal conflicts, scientific literature, and reports on weather and aggregated (not individual level) information on disease for humans and wildlife. Visuals will be created using two different approaches. One approach (MedINT Dashboard) is to view global mapping of the health security events, where each event is tagged on the map to its reported location. The map can be modified to view different health security layers and zoomed in/out to locations of interest. The second approach (MedINT Canvas) is to build a data visualization of interest by selecting topics, such as a disease, symptom, and location, and then observing if and how these topics connect through recent health security events. AI/ML will make this project possible by streamlining the pull of openly available online data into a machine-readable dataset. AI/ML will also support the MedINT Canvas visuals by finding relevant terms in online articles, labeling articles accordingly, and ranking them for relevance to topics of interest. These necessary steps cannot practically be performed by people. Allowing analysts to wholistically visualize health security data will enable identification of potential threats that should be further investigated. \n\nThe main AI system output will be the translation of online information into a structured, machine-readable dataset.

The AI algorithms are trained to identify likely non-explosive threat and prohibited items through image segmentation and object recognition.  \n\nCurrently, Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) assigned to scanners at airport checkpoints visually inspect each image.  The TSOs resolve the system generated explosive alarms as well as visually inspect the image for the presence of non-explosive prohibited items such as guns and sharp objects. TSA is working on developing new AI and Machine Learning ML algorithms to automate the search for the non-explosive prohibited items (e.g. guns, knives, etc.). These AI solutions benefit the public by providing a consistent and uninterrupted level of threat detection as an added layer of security. The ML algorithms allow the TSOs to be more flexible and to better prioritize their attention on important items to improve security. \n\nAI system output is a set of 3-dimentional bounding boxes that is displayed on the X-ray image. The bounding boxes are placed on top of objects or areas where the algorithm believes it has found a prohibited item (threat object).\n- Benefit Statement: This AI helps airplane luggage checks by the TSA officers scanning bags to have a continuous always watching partner to alert them to anything suspicious. \n\nCurrently, a Transportation Security Officer (TSO) who is assigned to every X-ray equipment at an airport checkpoint visually inspects each image. This officer resolves the system generated explosive alarms as well as visually inspecting the image for the presence of non-explosive prohibited items such as guns and sharp objects (see TSA Travel site).\nTSA is working on developing new Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms to automate the search for the non-explosive prohibited items (e.g. guns, knives, etc.).  Once a threat is found, the algorithm displays bounding boxes around the suspect item for the operator to then investigate and adjudicate.  \nThese AI solutions benefit the public by providing a consistent and uninterrupted level of threat detection as an added layer of security.

Role: Traveler, Goal: To pass through security screening quickly and efficiently, Benefit Statement: The new AI system using Low-PFA algorithms reduces alarm rates while providing gender neutral detection which result in faster passenger throughput.\n02. Role: TSA Officer, Goal: To effectively identify potential threats at security checkpoints, Benefit Statement: The new AI system utilizes ML to improve detection performance while decreasing alarm rates and passengers touch rates, making it easier for TSA officers to identify potentially dangerous items on passengers.\n03. Role: DHS Supervisor, Goal: To ensure the efficiency of security screening operations, Benefit Statement: The new AIT algorithm has increased throughput and utilization with the use of Low-PFA algorithms, improving overall efficiency of security screening operations.\n\nCategorization of Value Creation:\nThe use case is categorized as a Breakthrough Enabler because it introduces new technology (Low-PFA algorithms) that significantly enhances the accuracy and speed of AI systems deployed for on-person screening, which was not possible with previous detection models. This enables breakthrough performance improvements that were previously thought impossible.\n\nOperational Impact:\nThe potential operational impact of this use case includes improved process efficiencies due to faster passenger throughput resulting from reduced alarm rates and increased AIT throughput. It also expands the capabilities of TSA officers by providing them with more accurate detection models that make it easier for them to identify potentially dangerous items on passengers.\n\nTransformation Potential:\nThe use case has high transformation potential as it aligns with the traditional workflow of security screening, while also introducing new technological paradigms that significantly improve operational efficiency and accuracy. It departs from previous detection models that were prone to errors due to their reliance on outdated algorithms. This transformation will have a significant impact on the industry by raising the standard for security screening operations across all agencies.\n\nRisks and Mitigation Strategies:\nOne potential risk associated with this use case is the introduction of biases during training, which could lead to inaccurate detection rates among certain demographics. To address this, TSA can implement strategies such as collecting data from diverse populations or incorporating feedback mechanisms that allow for continuous improvement and adjustment of the algorithm.\n\nIndicators of Value Creation:\nKey indicators of value creation include operational metrics such as reduced alarm rates and increased throughput, as well as societal impacts such as improved security screening operations that protect passengers from potential harm. These indicators are explicit and can be measured objectively. Additionally, the introduction of new technological paradigms that significantly improve operation efficiency represents an implicit value driver that will have long-term benefits for the industry.\n\nComparison to Similar Use Cases:\nThis use case is similar to other AI use cases in the industry that aim to improve security screening operations through the use of advanced algorithms and ML models. However, it stands out due to its breakthrough potential by significantly improving accuracy and speed while also introducing new technological paradigms that align with traditional workflows.\n\nRecommendations for Improvement:\nTo improve the clarity, alignment, and strategic articulation of this use case, TSA can further elaborate on the operational impact and transformation potential of the use case by providing specific examples and metrics. Additionally, they can ensure that the algorithm is continually tested and updated to address any potential biases or limitations in order to maintain its effectiveness over time. Finally, TSA can consider implementing a feedback mechanism that allows passengers and officers to provide feedback on the performance of the AI system, which can inform future improvements."

The SPV Safety Task Force leveraged machine learning (ML) and subject matter expert (SME) input to create an adaptable, quantitative analysis tool that reliably identifies the key drivers of marine casualties and calculates a risk score for each vessel within the largest segment of the U.S.-inspected fleet. A vessel risk score is computed with an analytic model that leverages logistic regression and basic ML. The risk score is then combined with an SME-derived consequence score that considers the number of vessel passengers and operation distance from shore. The final combined number is used to categorize a vessel into one of three tiers: at the lowest risk tier, vessels will receive, at a minimum, mandated inspections as per Title 46 Code of Federal Regulations, while vessels in tiers 2 and 1 may receive more frequent or more thorough inspections by more experienced inspectors. Before an inspection recommendation is communicated to the vessel owner, an SME reviews and approves the vessel scores. Follow-on policy efforts set the required scope and frequency of inspection, the minimum competency of the lead inspector, and the level of accountability for each vessel. In addition to their modeling and policy efforts, this team conducted extensive education and outreach with the field, district, and area commands to aid adoption and foster implementation.

The use case output draws from FBI Background Check System (BCS) source information and is provided to USCIS officers to consider during case processing. For aliases, this solution uses a named-entity recognition (NER) model trained to understand the specific context around where aliases appear\u2014meaning it\u2019s effective at locating true aliases, while at the same time avoiding other places where proper names may exist but are not aliases (e.g., county or street names). For DOBs, this solution uses pattern matching and conditional logic to harvest valid birth dates, while weeding out obvious placeholders and other non-birth dates found within the IdHS text.  This use case has been in production since 2022 and is enabled only for N400. The solution was developed as a Python library, and the encasing Flask application runs on Amazon EKS. Its primary function is to predict where aliases and dates of birth appear within unstructured IdHS text.  It uses a named-entity recognition (NER) model, trained using Spark NLP with a TensorFlow back end on thousands of systematically labeled IdHS records, and word-level embeddings. \n\nThis use case reduces the amount of adjudicative time spent manually harvesting aliases and dates of birth (DOBs) from identity history summary (IdHS) report attached to the ELIS case as part of the Manual Name Harvesting Task during case processing. \n\nEliminates need for manual review by extracting unique names and DOBs from IdHS documents and when names/DOBs are already in ELIS, ANH will not suggest any names. This is still a human in the loop process. The ELIS user performing MNH tasks is prompted to decide if the suggested names and DOBs are related to case hence can accept/reject the suggestions. \n- Benefit Statement: To reduce the amount of adjudicative time spent manually harvesting aliases and dates of birth (DOBs) from identity history summary (idHS) report attached to the ELIS case as part of the Manual Name Harvesting Task during case processing.\n- System Outputs: Not provided\n</use_case>\n\nAddress the following key areas in your response:\nAA. **Named Entity Relationships**: Extract named entities in <use_case>.

The use case output informs USCIS Verification Account Compliance (VAC) analysts' decisions regarding whether a company applying to register on E-Verify is fraudulent and should be referred for investigation. ARGOS searches a multitude of public datasets for information that is then ranked and scored based on text analysis and a risk and fraud model developed in collaboration with the USCIS VAC team. The ARGOS application then displays that information to the end-user, allowing them to view the possibilities of fraud and make an informed decision. The goal of the use case is to streamline the process and accelerate work for the individual who is researching a company that has submitted its information for registration to E-Verify. \n\nARGOS sentiment analysis produces a risk score, and keyword extraction identifies the keyword category of interest to the VAC management and program analysts (MPAs) for the aggregated open-source information. This helps quickly identify any pertinent information to aid the MPAs in their open-source investigation of company applications. This process saves potentially thousands of MPA man-hours in open-source investigation and creates a single source of truth for each MPA's investigation of a company application. In turn, this allows for quicker application processing and, if the risk of company fraud exists, much faster referral processing time, expediting the next-step referral to Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) for further investigations. \n\nResponses are sent back to a user dashboard accessible internally only by VAC Management and Program Analyst (MPA) personnel.

BET is integrated with the National Appointment Scheduling System (NASS) and the Customer Profile Management System (CPMS). This improves data integrity as BET utilizes data already collected in USCIS systems, reducing the amount of data entry by the Biometric Technician and the risk of typographic errors. BET assists in determining if the fingerprint taken is good enough quality to pass the FBI fingerprint check process. It provides immediate feedback when a set of prints is likely to be rejected by the FBI by incorporating machine learning (ML) models into the BET application. The FBI will not disclose their quality grading criteria for fingerprints, leaving BET with the responsibility of determining quality to prevent unnecessary secondary encounters with applicants. Using even the simplest of models would catch 98% of rejected submissions, which could have potentially saved USCIS from scheduling 42,763 additional appointments in 2020. This would come at the cost of forcing recapture during 11% of encounters. This effort aims to maximize the number of successful FBI submissions while minimizing the number of fingerprint recaptures necessary.

This helps ensure photos are correct before making ID cards, saving time and avoiding delays. USCIS is the component within DHS that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. USCIS receives immigration requests from individuals seeking immigration and non-immigration benefits. Once a benefit request form is submitted to USCIS, a series of processing and adjudication actions occur. One of the case management systems used to track and adjudicate certain immigration request forms is the Electronic Information System (ELIS). USCIS ELIS is an internal case management system composed of microservices to assist with performing complex adjudicative and processing tasks; one of those microservices is the Photo Validation Service. The card photo validation solution was originally designed for e-filed I-765 (c)(3)s \u2014 to be in direct support of the beneficiary as they apply via myUSCIS. In enabling e-filing for the (c)(3)s, one goal was to have everything captured digitally, including these ID photos, all while avoiding any new delays or complications for the applicant in the process. In other words, if we observed an issue with a photo upon upload, we wanted to address it up front \u2014 rather than waiting until a failed card production sequence.  Because the photo requirements themselves are fixed, this exact same functionality could also be plugged directly into ELIS, just prior to card production. As of late October 2021, an effort to do exactly this is underway. The primary difference is that an adjudicator would explicitly request that a case\u2019s photo be validated, and if applicable, the service would return a recommendation to edit the photo before submission. \n\nThe photo validation service uses a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning models to validate photographs and ensure they meet the requirements, so these photographs can be used in card production. The output is Response back to user based on the pre-defined quality checks if the uploaded photo meets USCIS requirements. Users still have the option to ignore the warnings and upload the photo. \n- Benefit Statement: USCIS uses a system called ELIS to manage immigration requests, and it includes a Photo Validation Service to check if ID photos meet requirements.

This represents a significant improvement over previous manual methods for verifying ID photos, reducing the risk of errors or delays in the processing of immigration requests.\n\nGg. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies: \nOne potential risk associated with the use case is the possibility of biased decision-making by adjudicators who rely too heavily on automated photo validation results. To mitigate this risk, USCIS can provide training and resources to ensure that adjudicators are fully aware of the limitations of automated photo validation and understand how to use it effectively in conjunction with other factors when making decisions.\n\nAnother potential risk is the possibility of ethical concerns related to the collection and storage of sensitive personal information, such as ID photos. To mitigate this risk, USCIS can ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect personal data and that all staff are trained on best practices for handling sensitive information.\n\nOverall, the use case represents a significant improvement in the processing of immigration requests, but it is essential to address any potential risks or challenges before full implementation."

The solution systematically tags and surfaces critical evidence types for the adjudicators in Electronic Immigration System (ELIS). Until the Evidence Classifier ML solution's introduction, those working on cases and responsible for reviewing evidence documents would often have to sift through dozens, if not hundreds, of unlabeled pages to find one specific artifact. As a result, an ML solution was built to systematically tag individual pages with some of the highest-volume, highest-impact evidence types. \n\nThe service enables end users to navigate directly to the page(s) containing evidence documents of interest, instead of sifting through large PDF documents. Evidence tagging intends to accelerate case processing by identifying specific types of documents (e.g., I-589, passport photo spread, marriage certificate) and applying a metadata tag to that document object in ELIS. When a user opens a case with potentially hundreds of pages of evidence documents they have clickable bookmarks from these tags that will jump directly to the corresponding page. \n\nThe output is tagged evidence. The system inputs an image (scanned document from Lockbox) and outputs either a specific label, such as \"Border Crossing Card - Front,\" or no label if that document is not recognized as one of the classes. \n- Benefit Statement: To enable end users to navigate directly to the page(s) containing evidence documents of interest instead of sifting through large PDF documents.

The underlying immigrant petition defines if the I-485 is employment-based or family-based. It also has information about the visa classification and priority date which, when compared against the Department of State\u2019s monthly Visa Bulletin, helps predict visa usage. It is difficult to match an I-485 to its underlying immigrant petition, because the only available field on which to match is the Alien-number (A-number). This number is not always present on the immigrant petition, and name/date of birth matching is not as reliable.  The goal of I-485 Family Matching is to leverage AI to create connections more confidently between petitioners and their families based on limited data.  Additionally, it was intended to help identify and group I485s filed by family members, as well as gather up the many ancillary forms they may have been pending (such as I765, I131). Similar to immigrant petition matching, it can be difficult to match up I485s filed by family members. In these cases, the only similar fields are a common address. Efforts have been made in the past to identify family members by address, but it is effective only to a point. This use case explored the technical feasibility of using an AI model to help make working with this data more reliable (as well as group individual petitioners, their families, and other helpful associated data together for faster and more accurate processing).

Our dataset includes biographic information (e.g., name, date of birth, alien number Social Security Number, passport number) as well as biographic information (e.g., fingerprint IDs, eye color, hair color, height, weight) for model training and matching purposes. Critical to the success of PCIS is the entity resolution and de-deduplication of individual records from various systems of records to create a complete picture of a person. Using machine learning (ML), the model can identify which case management records belong to the same unique individual with a high degree of confidence. This allows PCIS to compile a full immigration history for an individual without the need for time-consuming research across multiple disparate systems. The de-duplication model plays a critical role in the entity resolution and surfacing of a person and all their associated records. The ML models are more resilient to fuzzy matches and handle varying data fill rates more reliably. \n\nUsing Machine Learning allows us to improve entity resolution as compared to rule-based system. PCIS offers the ability to see a person's immigration history organized in one place. Specific benefits do or will include: an organized summary view of the identity with the individual's latest photo from PCIS; full immigration history including receipts associated with the applicant, regardless of case management system; mailing, physical, and safe history of the individual organized in reverse chronological order, allowing users to easily find the most recent address; all identifiers associated with the applicant, including Alien number, Social Security Number, passport number, etc.; and a numerical likelihood score which is used to determine if the record belongs to the individual, subjected to a high threshold (.98, maximum 1) to assess whether the record belongs to the individual. \n- Benefit Statement: Using Machine Learning allows us to improve entity resolution as compared to rule based system.\n\nPCIS offers the ability to see a person's immigration history organized in one place.

By using machine learning to predict workloads and improve processing times for green card replacement applications, USCIS departs from traditional workflows that rely on manual analysis and prediction. This transformation will lead to more accurate and efficient processing of immigration applications, ultimately leading to a better experience for applicants.\nRisks and Mitigation Strategies:\nOne potential risk associated with the use case is the introduction of biases into the machine learning model. To mitigate this risk, USCIS should ensure that the data used to train the model is representative of the population it serves and that the model is tested for accuracy across different demographic groups. Another potential risk is dependence on the machine learning model, which could lead to a reduction in human analysis and decision-making. To mitigate this risk, USCIS should ensure that there is adequate oversight and review of the model's predictions by trained professionals.\nIndicators of Value Creation:\nKey indicators of value creation include operational metrics such as processing times for green card replacement applications, organizational benefits such as improved resource allocation, and societal impacts such as a better experience for immigrants applying for permanent residence in the United States. Explicit value drivers include improvements in process efficiencies, while implicit value drivers include a better experience for applicants and more accurate predictions of workloads.\nComparison to Similar Use Cases:\nThe use case compares to previously documented ones that use machine learning to predict workloads or improve processing times for immigration applications. One difference is the specificity of the use case, which focuses on green card replacement applications rather than general immigration application processing. Another difference is the specific technology used, H20 machine learning model, which distinguishes it from other use cases that may use different models or technologies.\nRecommendations for Improvement:\nTo improve the clarity and alignment of the use case, USCIS should ensure that the purpose statement, system outputs, and implementation context are coherent and well-defined. Additionally, they should ensure that the machine learning model is tested for accuracy across different demographic groups to mitigate any potential biases or limitations in the dataset. Finally, they should regularly review and assess the effectiveness of the use case to identify areas where improvements can be made."
