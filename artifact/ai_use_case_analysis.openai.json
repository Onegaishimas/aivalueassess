For these technical demonstrations, CBP\u2019s TVS may serve as the requested alternate procedure. Air carriers, in voluntary partnership with CBP, may purchase camera equipment in order to capture photos at check-in and again at baggage drop for transmission to CBP. The TVS matching service creates a biometric template of each international traveler\u2019s photo and compares it against templates of existing DHS holdings (i.e., U.S. passports, U.S. visas, and/or other DHS encounters) in order to provide identity verification on behalf of the CBP partner.\u00a0 In the event of a positive match, the TVS returns a unique identifier and matching results to the air carrier, and the traveler may proceed to finish the check-in/bag drop process. The matching result can be used by airlines (1) to meet their CBP regulatory requirement to verify specific passenger information and (2) their TSA regulatory requirement to accurately verify traveler\u2019s identities.

CBP uses TVS as its backend matching service for all biometric entry and exit operations that use Facial Comparison. CBP creates localized photo \"galleries\" from images captured during previous entry inspections, photographs from U.S. passports and U.S. visas, and photographs from other DHS encounters. The images are converted into templates and the actual photograph is discarded. The templates are securely stored, and are what make up the TVS gallery. The templates are then used by the Facial Comparison system to verify a traveler's identity when they arrive or depart the U.S. When the traveler presents him or herself for entry, or for exit, the traveler will encounter a camera connected to TVS. This camera matches live images with the existing photo templates from passenger travel documents. Once the camera captures a quality image and the system successfully matches it with historical photo templates of all travelers from the gallery associated with that particular manifest, the traveler proceeds to inspection for admissibility by a CBP Officer, or exits the United States.

These malware samples require manual reverse engineering to find actionable insights, such as indications of potential compromise or adversary-operated command and control. This AI capability uses deep learning to assist CISA analysts with understanding the content of malware samples, automating tasks such as triage and indicator extraction. This improves internal government tools for reverse engineering of malware, speeding the development of cyber threat intelligence that can be shared across the government and with CISA partners.  \n\nBy enhancing the analysis and generation of shareable cyber threat intelligence, CISA forces threat actors to spend more resources generating new malware.  A report is generated from malware samples submitted to the analysis pipeline, which is then used by human analysts to facilitate the malware triage process. Additional recommendations are displayed via plugins to reverse engineering tools. \n- Benefit Statement: This use case delivers improved internal government tools for reverse engineering of malware and speeding the development of cyber threat intelligence that can be shared across the government and with CISA partners.  Threat actors can leverage the same malware for long periods of time, so having the ability to improve analysis and generation of shareable cyber threat intelligence forces threat actors to spend more resources generating new malware.

Leveraging this intelligent retrieval technology does not rely on extensive application changes and offers substantial benefits in providing round-the-clock support while prioritizing complex inquiries. This initiative aims to enhance survivor satisfaction and call center efficiency by reducing call handle times and maintaining or improving answer quality.  The current applications for handling agent inquiries for processing applications are resource-intensive, leading to high operational costs and inefficiencies, especially during peak periods immediately following presidential-declared disasters. Currently, FEMA has a repository on SharePoint called the Processing Procedures Manual (PPM) that houses more than 70 documents that make up over 2,000 pages worth of content and guidance. Agents search this content and guidance with find function and keyword search, first having to find the right document, and then using keyword-based search and find functionality, negatively impacting efficiency and quality and leading to increases in escalations to higher tiers of agents/support who are no longer freed up to work on more complex situations.  Implementation of a 24/7 digital, interactive application will expedite guidance comprehension and discovery to provide better support to disaster survivors during active disasters. The system would use AI and search capabilities to intelligently analyze FEMA policies and guidance and assist the agents through the assistance review and award process.  \n\nThe AI will enable agents to retrieve information quickly, reducing the overall time spent on each call.  By providing more accurate and relevant search results, the AI will help agents deliver consistent, correct responses.  Reducing the time spent per call will improve operational efficiency, leading to potential cost savings.  By empowering agents with the correct information, the tool will lower the frequency of escalations to supervisors, allowing them to focus on more complex cases.  The time saved through the AI tool will allow agents to handle more complex queries, ultimately improving service quality and survivor satisfaction.  As the AI tool is rolled out, it will provide a scalable solution that can grow with the agency\u2019s needs during large-scale disaster responses. \n- Benefit Statement: The AI addresses the inefficiency in the current manual search process, where agents spend significant time navigating static documents like PDFs (2000+ pages/70 documents) to answer survivor questions. As policies can change frequently, especially during disasters, it is crucial that agents access the most up-to-date information quickly and accurately.\n\nExpected Benefits and Positive Outcomes:\nFaster Response Times: The AI will enable agents to retrieve information quickly, reducing the overall time spent on each call.\nImproved Answer Accuracy: By providing more accurate and relevant search results, the AI will help agents deliver consistent, correct responses.\nCost Savings: Reducing the time spent per call will improve operational efficiency, leading to potential cost savings.\nReduced Escalations: By empowering agents with the correct information, the tool will lower the frequency of escalations to supervisors, allowing them to focus on more complex cases.\nIncreased Capacity for Complex Casework: The time saved through the AI tool will allow agents to handle more complex queries, ultimately improving service quality and survivor satisfaction.\nScalability: As the AI tool is rolled out, it will provide a scalable solution that can grow with the agency\u2019s needs during large-scale disaster responses.\n- System Outputs: Not provided\n</use_case>\n\nIt will be very helpful if you will address these areas concisely:\n\n### **A.

RGO reviews satellite, aerial, and radar imagery to expedite damage assessments in the aftermath of a disaster. RGO is utilizing several AI techniques, including computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning, to help prioritize imagery exploitation by identifying areas likely having damage or debris. Areas indicated as likely having damage or debris are prioritized for imagery exploitation by analysts, reducing the time required for visual damage assessments. FEMA will integrate these automated tools for imagery-based damage assessments into RGO processes and systems to inform FEMA geospatial analysts. FEMA geospatial analysts will review output and develop recommendations, so FEMA can quickly detect and characterize damaged and undamaged buildings, identify concentrations of damage, detect debris, and support rapid response and recovery activities. AI models generate points or polygons over areas where damage or debris is likely. This output is a recommendation meant to trigger investigation by human analysts via traditional damage assessments. In large-scale incidents, imagery collection can be comprised of hundreds of thousands of miles of land and millions of structures.

It uses historical data to plan staffing needs but does not directly decide who gets staffed.  The model is used to make predictions about how the incident management (IM) workforce could respond to the Stafford Act incidents. A key area of application is the setting of IM workforce staffing levels (i.e., force structure). The model was constructed in R and delivered as an R package. The model uses various kinds of statistical inference and machine learning methods (i.e., multinomial regression, Bayesian multi-level modeling, etc.).  This use case leverages historic data on the deployment of FEMA personnel to anticipate requirements for disaster staffing and supporting assessments for overall readiness. It does not leverage demographic data, nor is it used to directly inform staffing decisions.

These models include, but not limited to, predicting the number of households that will register for the Individuals and Households Program (IHP), the number of households that will require direct housing assistance, the number of temporary transitional housing units needed, the number of applicants for Public Assistance, the number of PA projects that applicants will submit, the number of sites that will need to be inspected per PA project, and the cost of delivering assistance.  Supervised learning models include sample statistics, generalized linear models, decision trees, and deep neural networks. \n\nThe purpose of these supervised learning models is for informational purposes, to produce predictions for to-be-determined quantities of interest and for decisional purposes that may include implicit use (e.g., seeing a large number of households requiring assistance may motivate FEMA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to consider requesting additional funding for the Disaster Relief Fund) or explicit use (e.g., the number of estimated housing units required may be used to determine the number of housing units to order just-in-time). Anticipated benefits of using supervised learning models include increased predictive performance, timely predictions, quantification of uncertainty, and rigor. \n\nThese supervised learning models produce predictions, not recommendations or decisions (though they can inform human users in making recommendations and decisions). At minimum, these models will produce point predictions for the different quantities of interest for disaster declarations. Additionally, they may produce prediction intervals or predictive distributions as feasible and appropriate for the given prediction problem. Often these outputs will be shared via business intelligence tools (e.g., Tableau or PowerBI) for wide internal FEMA use. Some predictions may be shared with a more restricted audience through simpler means (e.g., an excel workbook) as appropriate. \n- Benefit Statement: The purpose of these supervised learning models is two-fold:\n\n1.\tFor informational purposes: the models will produce predictions for to-be-determined quantities of interest. These quantities are often of interest to Agency personnel in the field, region, and headquarters, as well as DHS, OMB, NSC, and the Whitehouse.\n2.\tFor decisional purposes: in addition to being informative, the model\u2019s predictions are likely to be used for decision making.

Unlike facial identification or recognition, the facial verification function uses a one-to-one matching approach of the individual presenting to the Monitoring App during their check-in by comparing it against the ATD participant\u2019s photograph captured upon enrollment to determine whether the person is who they declare themselves to be. The Monitoring App can be launched from either an ICE ATD-issued mobile device or from the participant\u2019s personal mobile device.  It takes a series of photos of the participant during enrollment, which are stored in the ISAP ATD case management system. During subsequently checks in, an automatic 1:1 verification image of the individual in front of the phone\u2019s camera is matched against the stored profile images to enable the ICE ATD Case Manager to verify the participant\u2019s identity, using a proprietary algorithm. The technology also recognizes if a \u201clive\u201d person is in front of the camera, as opposed to a representation or image of a person. There is a visual ICE ATD Case Manager review if there is no match or if the matching attempt generates an error alert.

ATD consists of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), which utilizes case management and technology tools to support noncitizens compliance with release conditions, court hearings, and final orders of removal, while allowing them to remain in their communities as they move through the immigration process or prepare for departure from the United States. Once individuals are in the ATD-ISAP program, officers periodically perform case reviews to determine if current levels of case management and technology assignment are appropriate for the noncitizen in the program or if they need to be adjusted. During the case review, the officer will consider numerous factors to include, but not limited to, current immigration status, supervision and compliance history, pending benefits, being a care giver or care provider, current immigration stage, pending criminal history and/or convictions, the hurricane score, and other factors. The factor known as the Hurricane Score is a quasi-binomial, binary classification machine learning (ML) model that is given information by an analyst that is known about an individual (factors from case management details and participant actions) and determines the probability that the individual will abscond based on absconding patterns the model has learned from inactive ATD-ISAP case data. The model returns a score from 1-5, with the higher number equating to a higher risk. The officer may use this score as one of the many factors previously described when deciding the appropriate level of case management and technology for noncitizens enrolled in the ATD-ISAP program. Because the hurricane score can quickly evaluate an enormous amount of information on thousands of noncitizens in the ATD-ISAP program, it provides officers with additional insight that they would not have otherwise had when performing a case review. \n- Benefit Statement: The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) division would like to explore technology that could help lead to time savings and eliminate human error due to overburdened officers.  An AI generated hurricane score could also minimize the risk that a factor is overlooked due to officers being overburdened.  The hurricane score may be one factor that is used to inform the decision-making process. The \u201cHurricane Score\u201d models the potential risk (1-5) that a noncitizen who is released from detention with the requirement to check in with ICE through monitoring will abscond from the program, with a higher number indicating a higher risk of absconding.\n- System Outputs: Not provided\n</use_case>\n\nIt will be very helpful if you will address these areas concisely:\n\n### **A.

This tool, intended for non-critical conversations, will supplement existing language services contracts by providing real-time capabilities during various touch points in the ICE process. ERO personnel, who regularly interact with individuals who speak little or no English, currently rely on professional interpretation and translation services, which can be slow to secure. The new machine learning (ML) solution aims to facilitate informal communication quickly and efficiently. When deployed, it will not be used alone for materials vital to an individual\u2019s rights or benefits, or when the source materials contain non-literal language, lack clear grammar, or are overly complex.  In such cases, ERO personnel must seek additional language assistance via bilingual staff or professional language lines. \n\nThe initiative, first spearheaded by the U.S. Coast Guard for maritime usage with support from the DHS Science and Technology Directorate through the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), received Fiscal Year 2022 funding for proof of concept. Solutions, in the form of mobile phone applications, are being developed under research and development phases and are projected to meet ERO\u2019s requirements by January 2026. The Machine Learning Translation Technology Initiative will offer real-time communication and translation services, providing voice-to-text, text-to-voice, and voice-to-voice translations in at least 21 languages. This technology will enhance the ability of ICE ERO personnel to provide meaningful access to programs and services for limited English proficient (LEP) noncitizens. \n- Benefit Statement: The solution will be used to facilitate non-critical communications only. When deployed to production, the solution should not be used alone, absent human quality control, when materials are vital to an individual\u2019s rights or benefits, or when the source materials contain non-literal language (e.g., slang, metaphor), lack clear grammar or structure, contain abbreviations or acronyms, or are overly complex, technical, or wordy. If any interactions indicate the presence of legal or medical issues or a need for greater accuracy, ERO personnel are required to seek additional language assistance via bilingual staff or a professional language line. The solution was first spearheaded by U.S. Coast Guard for maritime usage with the support of DHS Science and Technology Directorate through the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP).

        "Prompt": "\nAs a helpful assistant, please analyze the following AI use case <use_case>:\n\n<use_case>\n**Details:**\n- Use Case ID: DHS-204\n- Agency: DHS\n- Bureau / Department: ICE\n- Purpose Statement: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is a critical component of ICE, responsible for investigating crimes that threaten national security, public safety, and the economy. HSI\u2019s mission is to protect the United States from transnational crime and terrorism by disrupting organizations involved in human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, cybercrime, and other illicit activities. HSI relies on advanced technologies to analyze and process vast amounts of data, including audio and video evidence. Effective investigations depend on the ability to extract relevant information quickly and accurately from large volumes of unstructured reports. Traditional lexical search methods often fall short in this regard. Semantic Search and Summarization technology bridges this gap by leveraging large language models (LLM) to allow investigators to submit natural language queries.  These queries are analyzed to identify the most relevant information in reports, accelerating investigative analysis by rapidly identifying persons of interest, surfacing trends, and detecting networks or fraud. Furthermore, the system allows investigators to build reports by entering raw notes and leveraging LLM to generate a draft report that adheres to the Report of Investigation (ROI) manual's formatting and style guidelines. This saves time and produces more articulate and accurate reports. Once reviewed, validated, and approved by supervisors, the final report is uploaded to a case management system. HSI uses this tool to generate leads, with further action required by investigators and analysts as part of the full investigative process before any action is taken against an individual.\n- Benefit Statement: Effective investigations require querying large volumes of unstructured reports to extract and summarize contextually-relevant information. Current lexical search methods are insufficient for finding such information. Semantic Search and Summarization enables contextually-relevant information extraction and summarization from large volumes of unstructured investigative reports.

To provide faster answers, SEVP uses a chatbot named SEVIS Interactive Dialog (SID) to handle common questions from students and officials. If SID cannot help, it connects the caller to a human agent and shares the conversation to save time. Callers include visa holders (F, M, and J nonimmigrants), school and program officials, government users, and members of the public. Many questions are routine inquiries about established policies and procedures. SID is a conversational chatbot that uses voice recognition and Natural Language Understanding to understand and reply to users\u2019 questions with scripted answers. SID is deterministic and does not use generative AI. It answers frequently asked questions but SEVP will not be programmed SID to answer safety- and/or rights-impacting questions. If SID cannot answer a question, it transfers the caller to an agent in the response center. The chatbot captures the interaction with the caller and sends the information via an API to Student and Exchange Visitor Program Automated Management System (SEVPAMS). SEVPAMS creates a tickets, either for calls completed by SID or those handed over to an agent. This allows agents to see the dialog between SID and the caller, reducing the need to repeat information. This frees up the human agents to handle  more complex cases and specific record issues.\n- Benefit Statement: AI provides SID the ability to understand voices and its deterministic question and answer workflow (1) enables SID to answer routine caller questions without a help desk agent, and (2) when a help desk agent is required, SID will create a ticket with a caller transcript to reduce the burden on the agent.

These data will be pulled from online open sources to broadly include, for example, news on societal conflicts, scientific literature, and reports on weather and aggregated (not individual level) information on disease for humans and wildlife. Visuals will be created using two different approaches. One approach (MedINT Dashboard) is to view global mapping of the health security events, where each event is tagged on the map to its reported location. The map can be modified to view different health security layers and zoomed in/out to locations of interest. The second approach (MedINT Canvas) is to build a data visualization of interest by selecting topics, such as a disease, symptom, and location, and then observing if and how these topics connect through recent health security events. AI/ML will make this project possible by streamlining the pull of openly available online data into a machine-readable dataset. AI/ML will also support the MedINT Canvas visuals by finding relevant terms in online articles, labeling articles accordingly, and ranking them for relevance to topics of interest. These necessary steps cannot practically be performed by people.

By combining human, animal, plant, and environmental data, with critical infrastructure data, we aim to generate an integrated One Health data landscape that can aid decision making, early warning, and enhanced situational awareness. This would improve detection, prevention, and mitigation of emerging threats to health, food, and agriculture  (such as Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), climate, pests/vectors, invasive species, etc.) whether natural, intentional, or accidental, and promote health security, preparedness, and resilience across domains, disciplines, sectors, and stakeholders. OHTREADs will use a similar approach to Medical Intelligence (MedINT), employing a dashboard to present a telescoping global-to-local map that will highlight health incidents, cases, or other epidemiological relevant data that can be linked via geospatial or temporal factors. Upon clicking the map, the user will be able to achieve state or county level data visualization, or other relevant user-filtered information for active incidents involving pathogens/agents of interest, including risk and predictive transmission values.

Neither activity is, or can be, practically performed by people. AI/ML will be further used in Planner to generate risk and predictive scores in addtion to displaying relevant information and analyses that help analysts understand health security threats and broadly monitor the health security landscape. AI/ML is meant to provide comprehensive situational awareness for health surveillance and public health response, with target capabilities that: enable global situational awareness of current and potential health risks from a One Health perspective; assist in early warning of health threats by location, facility, and species; aid in rapid identification of health threats at population, facility, and greater geographic resolution; and support data-driven decision making to prevent, mitigate, and respond to health threats.\n- System Outputs: Not provided\n</use_case>\n\nIt will be very helpful if you will address these areas concisely:\n\n### **A.

The SPV Safety Task Force leveraged machine learning (ML) and subject matter expert (SME) input to create an adaptable, quantitative analysis tool that reliably identifies the key drivers of marine casualties and calculates a risk score for each vessel within the largest segment of the U.S.-inspected fleet. A vessel risk score is computed with an analytic model that leverages logistic regression and basic ML. The risk score is then combined with an SME-derived consequence score that considers the number of vessel passengers and operation distance from shore. The final combined number is used to categorize a vessel into one of three tiers: at the lowest risk tier, vessels will receive, at a minimum, mandated inspections as per Title 46 Code of Federal Regulations, while vessels in tiers 2 and 1 may receive more frequent or more thorough inspections by more experienced inspectors. Before an inspection recommendation is communicated to the vessel owner, an SME reviews and approves the vessel scores. Follow-on policy efforts set the required scope and frequency of inspection, the minimum competency of the lead inspector, and the level of accountability for each vessel. In addition to their modeling and policy efforts, this team conducted extensive education and outreach with the field, district, and area commands to aid adoption and foster implementation. Their efforts directly improved marine inspector allocation, targeted risk, and enhanced the governance necessary to increase passenger safety across the country. \n- Benefit Statement: The Small Passenger Vessels (SPV) Safety Task Force leveraged machine learning and subject matter expert input to create an adaptable, quantitative analysis tool that reliably identifies the key drivers of marine casualties and calculates a risk score for each vessel within the largest segment of the U.S.-inspected fleet.

As set forth in Section 451(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296, Congress charged USCIS with administering the asylum program. USCIS, through its Asylum Division within the Refugee, Asylum & International Operations Directorate (RAIO), administers the affirmative asylum program to provide protection to qualified individuals in the United States who have suffered past persecution or have a well-founded fear of future persecution in their country of origin, as outlined under Section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158 and Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), Part 208. Generally, an individual not in removal proceedings may apply for asylum through the affirmative asylum process regardless of how the individual arrived in the United States or his or her current immigration status by filing Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal. The ATA capability employs machine learning and data graphing techniques to identify plagiarism-based fraud in applications for asylum status and for the withholding of removal by scanning the digitized narrative sections of the associated forms and looking for common language patterns.\n- Benefit Statement: This use case is no longer an Active Use Case.

The use case output draws from FBI Background Check System (BCS) source information and is provided to USCIS officers to consider during case processing. For aliases, this solution uses a named-entity recognition (NER) model trained to understand the specific context around where aliases appear\u2014meaning it\u2019s effective at locating true aliases, while at the same time avoiding other places where proper names may exist but are not aliases (e.g., county or street names). For DOBs, this solution uses pattern matching and conditional logic to harvest valid birth dates, while weeding out obvious placeholders and other non-birth dates found within the IdHS text.  This use case has been in production since 2022 and is enabled only for N400. The solution was developed as a Python library, and the encasing Flask application runs on Amazon EKS. Its primary function is to predict where aliases and dates of birth appear within unstructured IdHS text.  It uses a named-entity recognition (NER) model, trained using Spark NLP with a TensorFlow back end on thousands of systematically labeled IdHS records, and word-level embeddings. \n\nThis use case reduces the amount of adjudicative time spent manually harvesting aliases and dates of birth (DOBs) from identity history summary (IdHS) report attached to the ELIS case as part of the Manual Name Harvesting Task during case processing. \n\nEliminates need for manual review by extracting unique names and DOBs from IdHS documents and when names/DOBs are already in ELIS, ANH will not suggest any names.

In addition, the FDNS Directorate is responsible for detecting, deterring, and combating immigration benefit fraud.  In 2005, USCIS developed a case management system, the Fraud Detection and National Security-Data System (FDNS-DS), to record, track, and manage the screening processes related to immigration applications, petitions, or requests with suspected or confirmed fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, and to identify vulnerabilities that may compromise the integrity of the legal immigration system.  In June 2023, FDNS-DS was replaced with a modernized case management system, FDNS-DS NexGen.  In the future, FDNS-DS NexGen may use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) data from other applications to aid in investigative work, enhance investigative case prioritization, and detect duplicate case work. USCIS may also integrate AI/ML into the predictive modeling for future system enhancements, working side-by-side with the business stakeholders to develop best practices.

This helps ensure photos are correct before making ID cards, saving time and avoiding delays. USCIS is the component within DHS that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. USCIS receives immigration requests from individuals seeking immigration and non-immigration benefits. Once a benefit request form is submitted to USCIS, a series of processing and adjudication actions occur. One of the case management systems used to track and adjudicate certain immigration request forms is the Electronic Information System (ELIS). USCIS ELIS is an internal case management system composed of microservices to assist with performing complex adjudicative and processing tasks; one of those microservices is the Photo Validation Service. The card photo validation solution was originally designed for e-filed I-765 (c)(3)s \u2014 to be in direct support of the beneficiary as they apply via myUSCIS. In enabling e-filing for the (c)(3)s, one goal was to have everything captured digitally, including these ID photos, all while avoiding any new delays or complications for the applicant in the process. In other words, if we observed an issue with a photo upon upload, we wanted to address it up front \u2014 rather than waiting until a failed card production sequence.  Because the photo requirements themselves are fixed, this exact same functionality could also be plugged directly into ELIS, just prior to card production. As of late October 2021, an effort to do exactly this is underway. The primary difference is that an adjudicator would explicitly request that a case\u2019s photo be validated, and if applicable, the service would return a recommendation to edit the photo before submission. \n\nThe photo validation service uses a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning models to validate photographs and ensure they meet the requirements, so these photographs can be used in card production. The output is Response back to user based on the pre-defined quality checks if the uploaded photo meets USCIS requirements. Users still have the option to ignore the warnings and upload the photo. \n- Benefit Statement: USCIS uses a system called ELIS to manage immigration requests, and it includes a Photo Validation Service to check if ID photos meet requirements.

Until the Evidence Classifier ML solution's introduction, those working on cases and responsible for reviewing evidence documents would often have to sift through dozens, if not hundreds, of unlabeled pages to find one specific artifact.

The underlying immigrant petition defines if the I-485 is employment-based or family-based. It also has information about the visa classification and priority date which, when compared against the Department of State\u2019s monthly Visa Bulletin, helps predict visa usage. It is difficult to match an I-485 to its underlying immigrant petition, because the only available field on which to match is the Alien-number (A-number). This number is not always present on the immigrant petition, and name/date of birth matching is not as reliable.  The goal of I-485 Family Matching is to leverage AI to create connections more confidently between petitioners and their families based on limited data.  Additionally, it was intended to help identify and group I485s filed by family members, as well as gather up the many ancillary forms they may have been pending (such as I765, I131). Similar to immigrant petition matching, it can be difficult to match up I485s filed by family members. In these cases, the only similar fields are a common address. Efforts have been made in the past to identify family members by address, but it is effective only to a point.

The de-duplication model ingests person-centric datasets from various source systems for model training and evaluation purposes. Our dataset includes biographic information (e.g., name, date of birth, alien number Social Security Number, passport number) as well as biographic information (e.g., fingerprint IDs, eye color, hair color, height, weight) for model training and matching purposes. Critical to the success of PCIS is the entity resolution and de-deduplication of individual records from various systems of records to create a complete picture of a person. Using machine learning (ML), the model can identify which case management records belong to the same unique individual with a high degree of confidence. This allows PCIS to compile a full immigration history for an individual without the need for time-consuming research across multiple disparate systems. The de-duplication model plays a critical role in the entity resolution and surfacing of a person and all their associated records. The ML models are more resilient to fuzzy matches and handle varying data fill rates more reliably. \n\nUsing Machine Learning allows us to improve entity resolution as compared to rule-based system. PCIS offers the ability to see a person's immigration history organized in one place.

That means USCIS receives, processes, and maintains all applications for admission for Lawful permanent residents (LPRs), or adjustments to LPR status. Also known as \u201cgreen card\u201d holders, LPRs are non-citizens who are lawfully authorized to live permanently within the United States and are required to fill out Form I-90, Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card (Green Card). Since there has been a considerable influx of green card applications, USCIS used a combination of exploratory data analysis to determine the most used categories for applicants submitting I-90's and machine learning to create predictions of workloads. As a follow-on, USCIS used Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models on the I-90 form, which allowed the prediction of the total number of forms for a 2-year period. ARIMA is one of the easiest and effective machine learning algorithms to perform time series forecasting. This capability has been deployed in production for more than a year.

The USCIS Translation Service assesses the effectiveness and security of GenAI-powered translation tools for document translation and real-time interpretation. AI and GenAI models trained on relevant subjects (e.g., immigration law, visa applications, family/adoption certificates) provide fast, accurate translation of written or other digital documents in various languages. AI and GenAI-powered speech-to-speech and speech-to-text translation tools enable efficient communication, consultations, and other interactions within DHS. Supporting language translation and transcription is crucial for operations and adjudications across all DHS components. One use case application involves United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) document translation, a time-consuming task for Resettlement Support Center (RSC) caseworkers before USCIS interviews. Documents include passports, national identifications, birth certificates, and more complex documents.

This supports two key USCIS Verification Division (VER) programs: the Employment Verification Program (E-Verify) and the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program.  The model streamlines verification data integration services by providing a ranked order of the best matches, expressed as confidence scores, between the identifiers used by the two programs. These improved matches increase the accuracy of E-Verify and SAVE, ensuring they use the most recent and accurate documents to determine benefit status. E-Verify handles approximately 250,000 requests per day and SAVE handles approximately 70,000 requests per day. Multiple data verification models for SAVE and E-Verify exist, complicating efficiency and performance. By consolidating these into a single, unified Verification Match Model within a separate microservice, the use case aims to improve the accuracy of responses and reduce the need for manual review. ML plays a key role in the continuous improvement of these models, ultimately reducing the need for manual case reviews. \n\nLeveraging AI in the USCIS verification matching process of known records across systems is beneficial because it streamlines existing USCIS reviews by 1) improving system accuracy, 2) reducing human error through automated person-and-record match scoring, and 3) handling a higher volume of matches than traditional tools or manual processes can achieve.  The ouput is a recommendation and score indicating person-and-record match probability, used by verification systems (E-verify and SAVE) to improve accuracy in initial system responses. \n- Benefit Statement: Leveraging AI in the USCIS verification matching process of known records across systems is beneficial because it streamlines existing USCIS review by 1) improving associated system accuracy, 2) reducing human-error by automating person-and-record match scoring, and 3) matching at a higher volume than traditional tools or manual processes can capably achieve.\n- System Outputs: Not provided\n</use_case>\n\nIt will be very helpful if you will address these areas concisely:\n\n### **A.
