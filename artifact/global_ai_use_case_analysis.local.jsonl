This suggests that performance is a key consideration for the system, which must be able to process incoming data quickly and accurately.\n- **Scalability**: The system must be scalable enough to handle varying levels of traffic at border and security checkpoints. This indicates that the system's architecture must be designed with scalability in mind to ensure it can handle increased demand without sacrificing performance or accuracy.\n\n### **D. Value Categorization**\nBased on the proposed functional and non-functional requirements, we can classify this use case as a \"Capability Enhancer\". It introduces new capabilities, expanding operational boundaries by enabling more accurate identification of potential IOIs while overcoming limitations imposed by false alarms. This enables CBP to focus on legitimate risks more efficiently.\n\n### **E. Operational Impact and Transformation**\nThe anticipated operational impact of this use case is to improve efficiency by minimizing the time spent on non-threatening activities, while also expanding the scope of tasks that can be performed with greater accuracy. The key transformation introduced by this use case is the ability to differentiate between valid IOIs and false alarms, which previously may have hindered CBP's operations at border and security checkpoints.\n\n### **F. Value Metrics**\nThe value of this use case can be measured through a combination of operational metrics such as time saved, as well improved efficiency in identifying potential items of interest while minimizing false alarms. Societal impact is also an important consideration, as the ability to detect and classify IOIs accurately can improve overall security at border and security checkpoints.
